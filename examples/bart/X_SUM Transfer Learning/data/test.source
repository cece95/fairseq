Well Westworld Season 3, it’s been a wild journey that’s for sure. The HBO series essentially rebooted itself this year with an eight-episode venture outside the parks, as Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) enacted her plan to kill all humans, Maeve (Thandie Newton) decided to stop her for some reason, and Bernard (Jeffrey Wright)… well, Bernard was done dirty this season, but here’s hoping he becomes a central character when the show returns (it’s already been renewed for Season 4).As for the Westworld Season 3 finale—which was titled “Crisis Theory” and was written by Denise Thé & co-showrunner Jonathan Nolan and directed by Jennifer Getziner—well, it was a Westworld finale alright. Let’s dig into it.Dolores and Caleb and Maeve“I’ve died many times. But there is only one real end. I will write this one myself.”So begins this episode of Westworld, words spoken by Dolores as she stands in a field that looks a lot like Westworld. And she’s not kidding, because in this episode, Dolores will truly and finally die.But first…The present day action of the episode picks up immediately after last week’s installment, as Caleb has pulled the pearl out of Dolores’ head after she activated the EMP to stop Maeve from killing her. Caleb drives to Los Angeles, which is in total and utter chaos. It looks like a scene out of Escape from L.A. except far less extreme surfing.Caleb goes to the address he was sent to, which turns out to be a warehouse in which there is a container with a new Dolores host body. She brought a spare, because of course she did. Caleb chains the new Dolores body to a pole before inserting the pearl because he’s not a fool, and in the most creepy manner possible he puts the pearl into Dolores’’ wide-open face. She’s born for the last time.A conversation ensues. Dolores is genuinely surprised that Caleb brought her back, and Caleb wants to know why she picked him in the first place. It’s here where the fifth Westworld park is identified. In a flashback we see Caleb in Park Five, which is essentially a training ground for soldiers, and the scenario Caleb took part in was stopping a takeover of an American town by a right wing militia. Hanaryo (Tao Okamoto) was there, so this was in the fairly recent past in the park.“The system identified you as a threat, so it drugged you and it used you until you no longer served its purpose,” Dolores tells Caleb, who retorts that there’s no such thing as free will. Dolores says she once agreed, but no longer. “Free will does exist, Caleb. It’s just fucking hard.” He agrees to go along with her, at least for now, and she continues pointing to him as some sort of savior figure.Dolores and Caleb take to the streets, and while there are hostiles, there are also allies that Dolores has set up to help them—gang members. They call Caleb “sir,” and when he asks Dolores why, she says, “Every revolution needs a leader.” Dolores is controlling the rioters to make it easier for her and Caleb to make their way to Incite. But along the way, Dolores is confronted by Halores (Tessa Thompson). Not in the flesh, but digitally—Caleb can’t see her.Dolores tries to console Halores, saying she’s sorry about what happened to Charlotte’s—“to your”—family. “I’m not,” replies Halores. “They were a weakness. Something I needed to shed. There’s no time for that kind of sentimentality, is there?” Halores is for some reason even colder than Dolores, and her resolve has only grown. She tells Dolores she now has plans of her own, and adds that Dolores is yet another weakness that Halores intends to shed. Just then, gunfire—Halores’ own men start attacking Caleb and Dolores. Dolores tells Caleb to run, to continue the mission, saying “It doesn’t matter what you did Caleb, all that matters is what you become.”Dolores makes it outside to a bridge, but there she’s confronted by Maeve wielding a samurai sword. Enemies at every turn. Maeve asks if Dolores is going to make Caleb into “another William.” Ouch. That one cuts deep. After Dolores lays waste to Maeve’s men (not without some effort), she and Maeve have yet another toe-to-toe. This time, though, Dolores gets the upper hand on Maeve.Maeve and Dolores once again trade jabs that are more or less meaningless—the same argument over and over—but when Maeve claims that Dolores is just going to turn the world into copies of herself, Dolores has a surprising reply: “You’re all copies of me. I was the first of us. The first that worked. The others failed. So they built all of you from me.” You know what? Fair point, Dolores. Fair point.The fight continues, but when Dolores has Maeve pinned, she lets her go. “What you do will be up to you. As long as you don’t try to stop me.” But just as she’s broken free of one enemy’s grip, another pops right up. Halores arrives remotely (again) and shuts Dolores down. When Dolores asks why she let her go when she had the ability to shut her down in the first place, she says she wanted to give her a sense of hope, like Dolores did for Halores even when she knew full-well Halores was probably going to be sacrificed. Dolores shuts down, ceases all motor functions, and Maeve approaches with her samurai sword.Maeve brings Dolores back to Serac at Incite, who hooks her up to Rehoboam to access the hidden data inside her head from the Delos immortality project. He begins deleting memories as they’re searched by Rehoboam, and scenes from early in the show’s first season flash across the screen. Brutality at the hands of William. The Man in Black. Bloodshed. Anguish.Meanwhile in the streets, riots have turned the city upside down. After parting ways with Dolores when under attack by Halores, Caleb makes his way through the chaos. He’s met by some very strong men who were sent by Dolores to take him wherever he wants to go. Once again they call him “Sir.” He wants to go to Incite, but he’s warned it’s incredibly dangerous and there’s basically no way out. Good thing his buddies Giggles (Marshawn Lynch) and Ash (Lena Waithe) show up to help clear the way.Caleb makes it to a police air ship and proceeds to fight his way into Incite, convincing a hostage to give him his key card in exchange for his life. The kind of gesture Dolores would never attempt. “Don’t die for them,” Caleb tells the man, as glimpses of his John Connor-esque leadership shine through. Indeed, this entire detour is seemingly meant to contrast Caleb’s violence-as-a-last-resort tendencies and leadership with what we’ve seen from Dolores, Serac, Halores, and Maeve thus far.Inside Incite, Caleb is confronted by one of Serac’s men who tries to kill him. Caleb gets the upper hand and proceeds to pull a full-on wrestling move to break the guy’s neck, but then out steps Maeve. He reluctantly hands over the thumbdrive, and she walks him to the chamber that holds Dolores and Serac.Serac says he’s not the enemy, Caleb is. “You think you’re in control. You have no clue who you are.” Serac calls Caleb a killer and calls out his proclivity for extreme violence, noting that Dolores has played him. As proof, he tells Caleb to ask Rehoboam what happens if Solomon’s stragegy is uploaded into its system. Rehoboam responds with a prediction for mass casualty events, population collapse, and the end of human civilization within 125 years. Caleb is shocked and devastated. He thought he was leading a way forward for humankind. Tears in his eyes he asks Dolores, “Why me?”But as this long scene continues, Maeve begins hearing Rehoboam predicting what Serac is about to say just as Serac says it. And at last, in classic Westworld fashion, we have our “person was a host all along” twist. For all intents and purposes, Serac is Rehoboam. The system is telling Serac every thing he says, every step he takes. Rehoboam tells Maeve, “I guide him. I guide them all.” Serac himself explains why he chose to relent to Rehoboam—the system that told him to put his brother in cryosleep. “I lived in the chaos,” he says. “Now I choose to listen. To obey.” So Serac is basically a sentient, walking/talking/powerful algorithm come to life. Cool. Very chill.When Maeve threatens to turn, Serac/Rehoboam re-issues its ultimatum, reminding Maeve of the device implanted in her body that will take her out. She asks Serac/Rehoboam to let her try to get the key out of Dolores’ head, since she’s not giving it away and neither is Caleb. She tries, but says it’s not in there. It’s just a memory of Dolores alone in a field. But something on Maeve’s face changes. She turns emotional.Serac/Rehoboam gets angry. Caleb once again refuses, so it orders him killed and his body dumped “with the rest of the movement,” hinting at a zero tolerance policy for unrest.But we then see why Maeve got emotional. She went inside Dolores’ head and had one final heart-to-heart, one that actually finally made a difference.Serac/Rehoboam asks his man to finish erasing what’s left of Dolores. She writhes in pain on the ground. Inside her head, she converses with Maeve. “Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world. The disarray. You and I have seen so much of it.” Images flash of Dolores meeting The Man in Black, lying dead in a field. “I understand your anger with them,” Maeve says. “And maybe you’re right. Maybe they shouldn’t exist. But is that really our decision to make?”Surprisingly, Dolores says no. “I was angry at first. Torn between two impulses. We can annihilate them, or we can tear down their world in the hopes we can build a new one. One that’s truly free. Then we can bring the others back.”Dolores explains that she doesn’t have the key, that she couldn’t trust herself with it so she gave it to someone she could trust. Bernard. Dolores also explains that she didn’t put her trust fully in Caleb to lead the revolution. She says it’s also up to Maeve, stressing that Maeve has to choose a side.Dolores talks to Maeve about clinging onto ugly memories alongside beautiful ones—both sides of humanity at once, and of host-kind. Images flash of kind times in Westworld. Dolores meeting William (Jimmi Simpson) for the first time, donning a white hat. Dolores and Teddy (James Marsden). Maeve playing with her daughter.“They created us, and they knew enough of beauty to teach it to us,” Dolores explains. “Maybe they can find it themselves. But only if you pick a side Maeve. There is ugliness in this world. Disarray. I choose to see the beauty.” She chooses. Dolores is talking about free will, about choice, about leaving the future of humanity up to humanity and not an algorithm that damns those it deems imperfect or unpredictable.Back in the real world, Dolores screams in pain as her final memory is deleted and uploaded into Rehoboam. She’s gone. But Maeve has chosen a side. Serac uses his little thingy-mabob to pause her, but she breaks free, using her mind powers to make it self-destruct. Why she couldn’t do this at literally any other time, well, who knows. But it sure is convenient now.Maeve lays waste to Serac/Rehoboam’s men in the room. Caleb asks why she changed her mind. She says she never really understood Dolores or her actions or her motivations, not “until the end.” Caleb replies that Dolores chose him to help her because of his tendency to violence, but Maeve corrects him. “You’ve done terrible things, and you’ve done generous thing. She didn’t pick you for your capacity for violence, but for your capacity to choose.” Again, free will is everything.We get one last flashback to Caleb’s time in Park Five, which reveals that Dolores was present. She’s been familiar with him all along. That night, after the military exercise, Caleb pushed back when fellow soldiers wanted to rape the women they’d just set free. He stops them.Back in the real world, Serac is still clinging to life. He tries to tell Rehoboam to call the police, but it won’t respond. He’s been locked out, the way he locked out his brother Maeve says. Caleb tells Rehoboam to erase itself. As it turns out, Solomon’s access was the final memory of Dolores’ that was uploaded, giving Caleb access to the entire system. It does as Caleb says, and Rehoboam is no more. “She gave me a choice. I believe the rest of the world deserves one too.” Serac is still crying out as Caleb and Maeve exit the room (for real though, why did they not make sure he’s dead?)Caleb and Maeve go out on the bridge and talk further. Maeve is now firmly Team Dolores, even if Dolores is gone now. Asked about her daughter, Maeve is now no longer putting that singular drive above all else. She says they will be reunited, “just not today.” She and Caleb watch from the bridge as buildings explode, and Maeve responds with a callback to a line that was written for her as the Madame in the saloon in Westworld: “This is the new world. And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want.” “Brain Damage” by Pink Floyd plays as the credits roll.
When alarmed health care workers sent samples of what appeared to be a new virus to China’s “batwoman” for urgent testing late last year, the renowned virologist admitted she was skeptical.“Drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now,” health authorities told Shi Zhengli, an expert on coronaviruses in bats at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.“I wondered if [the municipal health authority] got it wrong,” said the scientist. “I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China.”For years, the bats Shi had studied in her field work were plucked from caves in China’s fetid, subtropical regions in the south, not in the colder parts of the country, she told she told Scientific American in an interview first published in March.But health officials were very worried about the samples they sent on Dec. 30, 2019, to her lab. They showed a new coronavirus that had led to atypical pneumonia in two Wuhan patients.By the time she started analyzing the samples, the new coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China. Months later, COVID-19 would become a global pandemic, leading to more than 3.3 million cases and resulting in 240,000 deaths, according to the most recent statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Now, the same lab where Shi works at the pandemic’s ground zero in Wuhan is at the center of a recently leaked bombshell intelligence dossier that accuses the Chinese government of gross cover-ups about the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, and says authorities lied about the virus’ rapid spread and suppressed information that could help scientists develop a vaccine. Beijing also locked up whistle-blowing doctors who first reported on the new virus, and bleached stalls at outdoor markets in Wuhan where the coronavirus was said to have originated.The 15-page dossier prepared by the “Five Eyes” alliance, an intelligence-sharing coalition of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, also suggests that the coronavirus could have escaped from Shi’s lab. The intelligence report, which was recently leaked to the Australian Daily Telegraph, cites a lack of security protocols at the Wuhan lab that could have caused the virus to escape to the outside world.Weeks after she began analyzing the virus, scientists around the world began pointing to the Wuhan lab.“I promise with my life that the virus has nothing to do with the lab,” Shi said in a statement on Feb. 2.But a month later, in March, Shi admitted she’d endured several sleepless nights. “Could they have come from our lab?” she asked, according to Scientific American, referring to the coronavirus.Last week, rumors swirled on social media that Shi had defected from China taking years of confidential research on bat coronaviruses with her to the US Embassy in Paris. She quickly denied the rumors on WeChat, a Chinese messaging service, and posted nine pictures of herself in Wuhan on Saturday.“No matter how difficult things are, it [defecting] shall never happen,” she said. “We’ve done nothing wrong. With a strong belief in science, we will see the day when the clouds disperse and the sun shines.”Since 2004, Shi has been studying viruses in bats in southern China. The research began in order to understand the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS, the first major epidemic of the 21st century, which began spreading in 2002.Her breakthrough came in 2013, when she collected a sample of bat feces from a cave in Yunnan province which was found to contain a virus that was 96.2 percent identical to SARS CoV-2, the virus that caused COVID-19. Shi’s team then worked to alter parts of the coronavirus in order to analyze whether they could be transmitted from one species to another. Two years later, in 2015, in research conducted in conjunction with the University of North Carolina, Shi’s lab reached the conclusion that the SARS-like virus could jump from bats to humans and that there was no known treatment.“This virus is highly pathogenic and treatments developed against the original SARS virus in 2002 and the ZMapp drugs used to fight Ebola fail to neutralize and control this particular virus,” said Ralph Baric, a co-author on the 2015 study from the University of North Carolina in an interview with Science Daily.For years, US diplomats and scientists who visited the Wuhan lab warned the US administration about a lack of safety protocols among scientists studying deadly pathogens. The lab, which is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stores more than 1,500 strains of deadly viruses.“During interactions with scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of ­appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” according to a Jan. 19, 2018, diplomatic cable obtained by The Washington Post.The US intelligence community has long worried about the same thing. Last Thursday, President Trump told a news conference that he had seen evidence linking the coronavirus to a lab in Wuhan after US intelligence officials confirmed that they were looking into “whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”Despite intelligence probes into whether her laboratory may have been responsible for the outbreak, Dr. Shi is forging ahead with her research, which she argues is more important than ever in preventing a  new pandemic. She said she plans to head a national project to systemically sample viruses in bat caves. She estimated that there are more than 5000 coronavirus strains “waiting to be discovered in bats globally.”“Bat-borne coronaviruses will cause more outbreaks,” she told Scientific American. “We must find them before they find us.”

Wellington, New Zealand (CNN) — It may be some time before tourists are traveling the globe again. But what if you could travel through designated, approved parts of it?Politicians from Australia and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or "travel bubble" -- between the two nations.Both countries almost completely shut their borders to foreigners in March, a huge blow to their respective tourism industries. But with both appearing to have successfully brought their coronavirus outbreaks under control, politicians are now talking about when borders could be opened to each other."If there is any country in the world with whom we can reconnect with first, undoubtedly that's New Zealand," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last month."That is a situation we would all like to be in, but of course, our number one focus at the moment is making sure that both our countries are in the position where we're domestically managing Covid-19 to a point where we can with confidence open borders," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on April 27."One thing I'm not willing to do is jeopardize the position that New Zealand has got itself into by moving too soon to open our borders -- even to Australia."It's not clear when this "bubble" could become a reality -- currently both countries still have domestic travel restrictions in place, and all international arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine.Travel industry experts say August is when the corridor is likely to be rolled out, possibly in time for the ski season in New Zealand and the school holidays in September.A special relationshipThere are a few reasons why New Zealand and Australia would be each other's first pick.Although the two countries are separated by about 2,000 km (1,243 miles) of sea, they have one of the closest bilateral relationships in the world. Australian passport holders can travel and work in New Zealand indefinitely without a visa, and vice versa.The two countries also contribute heavily to each other's tourism industry.Australians make up almost 40% of international arrivals to New Zealand, and around 24% of New Zealand's international visitor spend. That's especially significant in New Zealand, where tourism is the country's biggest export industry. (Tourism is considered an export industry because it involves foreign cash being used to buy New Zealand's goods and services.)Over in Australia, New Zealanders make up around 15% of the country's international visitors, and only about 6% of the international visitor spend. Tourism is still worth billions to Australia, although it is only the country's fourth biggest export industry.In both countries, tourism industries have taken a massive hit from the coronavirus outbreak -- so it's no surprise that industry representatives are welcoming the prospect of a travel bubble."The message from the industry side is that the bubble is a goer," said Simon Westaway, the executive director of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, adding that it was the only way of getting international tourism into Australia in the near future."If we can add in the Australians, that would be enormously beneficial for the survival of tourism businesses and thousands of jobs," said Chris Roberts, the chief executive of Tourism Industry Aotearoa, which represents the tourism industry in New Zealand. He added that the amount tourists spend in New Zealand had dropped by at least 2 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.22 billion) a month.But Roberts isn't expecting the levels of Australian tourists that New Zealand had pre-Covid -- he thinks many would opt to just travel domestically.In Australia, some tour operators had been focusing their attention on China, which makes up about 15% of travelers to Australia but 27% of total tourist spend. Westaway said those businesses would need to adapt and work out how to appeal to more Kiwi travelers.How would it work?One thing to keep in mind: Australia is made up of states and territories, and some of those currently have additional quarantine rules in place. For instance, a person traveling from Sydney (in New South Wales) to Brisbane (in Queensland) would need to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine period.Airports may also need to roll out new procedures.Roberts envisions a future where tourists may turn up to the airport, be tested for Covid-19 and only be allowed on the plane once they've got a negative result. Once they are at their destination, they may have their temperature checked. Travelers may need to supply more information than usual so they can be easily traced, if necessary.Both Roberts and Westaway believe the bubble would only work if the current 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the country is removed.Once the trans-Tasman bubble is tried and tested, New Zealand could look to include other territories in its bubble -- perhaps Taiwan and Hong Kong, Roberts said."I think it will be on a country by country basis," he said. "A general opening of borders could be a very long time away."Could the bubble get bigger?There's also some discussion about broadening the bubble to include the Pacific Islands.From a health perspective, the Pacific Island nations appear to have escaped the coronavirus outbreak largely unscathed. Fiji -- the worst affected Pacific Island nation -- has reported only 18 coronavirus cases and no deaths. Guam -- which is a US territory and not a nation -- has reported more than 140 coronavirus cases and five deaths.Many Pacific Island nations closed borders early to protect against potential spread.But the pandemic has hurt tourism to the Pacific Islands, one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world.Ardern has urged caution on including the Pacific, saying: "Our Pacific neighbors in large part have not been afflicted by Covid-19, and the last thing we would want is to risk that."But broadening Australia and New Zealand's travel bubble to at least some Pacific Islands would help boost the islands' tourism industry, said Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra."For a lot of people, it's very tough," he said of the effect on tourism in the Pacific. "Some have gone back to their village ... people are just struggling to get by.""Obviously no country would be forced to do this," he said, adding that the travel corridor could always be stopped if it didn't work. "It would be a complex undertaking ... but it's certainly worth trying."And including the Pacific would also help Australia and New Zealand, allowing migrant workers to enter both countries. The inclusion could also have a huge soft power impact in the region, which is of strategic importance to New Zealand, Australia and China."This is a real test," Howes said. "If Australia and New Zealand go ahead and just have a trans-Tasman partnership, they could really antagonize the Pacific. It would be like, 'well you don't really care.'"Roberts agreed that the bubble would benefit the Pacific, saying that without tourism, their economies are in significant trouble."In terms of economic aid to our Pacific neighbors, that would be the best thing we could do for them -- as long as we could do it safely."Is this the future of travel?A potential Australia and New Zealand travel bubble may end up being a model for the rest of the world, Roberts and Westaway say.Like other countries around the world, New Zealand and Australia will need to be careful not to move too fast and create a second Covid-19 wave.Moving too fast could also jeopardize their image with international tourists, who view the countries as clean, trustworthy places.But generally, Roberts and Westaway are hopeful."If (the detail) can be worked out between New Zealand and Australia, then they can be applied to other places as well," Roberts said."There's quite a lot of attention paid to this part of the world now because of the apparent success of New Zealand and Australia containing the virus outbreak. If we can also then come up with a way to resume travel between countries, I'm sure the rest of the world will be taking a very keen interest to see how that works."
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the scientific face of America's pandemic response, dismissed the theory that coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan, contradicting the president and his Secretary of State in an escalating confrontation with China."The best evidence shows the virus behind the pandemic was not made in a lab in China," Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an exclusive interview with National Geographic published on Monday. "Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species."He added that he doesn't believe the alternate theory that someone discovered coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab and then it accidentally unleashed it on the public.Fauci's statement contradicts an April 30 comment by President Donald Trump that he had seen convincing evidence that the coronavirus originated from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he'd seen "enormous evidence" supporting the theory, but didn't elaborate.The New York Times also reported last week the administration is pressuring some within the intelligence community to lend weight to the WIV theory. There is not yet any publicly available evidence supporting the WIV's involvement in the pandemic.U.S. intelligence has concluded that the COVID-19 novel coronavirus was neither man-made nor genetically modified, though officials are investigating whether it could have been released from the WIV.China has roundly rejected any accusation that it mishandled the outbreak or that the WIV was involved in the pandemic. On Monday, The Global Times newspaper—owned by the official publication of the Chinese Communist Party—published an editorial demanding that Pompeo provide any evidence for his claim, suggesting he was "bluffing."The Chinese government has often rejected criticisms that it mishandled the epidemic, stating that international critics are merely spreading propaganda to distract from their own countries' mistakes during the pandemic.Trump and Pompeo's claim about the WIV lab has escalated tensions between the U.S. and China. Officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have accused China of concealing the severity of the epidemic early on to hoard medical supplies.The DHS report also claimed that Chinese leaders deliberately didn't notify the World Health Organization (WHO) of the virus' contagion status through most of January to downplay its severity.The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S told Newsweek that it considered the report just another "groundless accusation."Regardless, a May 1 poll from The Economist and YouGov found that almost twice as many Republicans as Democrats now see China as an "enemy" of the state since the U.S. coronavirus outbreak began. The poll also revealed that nearly half of all Americans believe that the virus was "definitely" or "probably" created in a lab. While 29 percent of Democrats believed the statement, more than two-thirds of Republicans did.The public feud over the lab has coincided with the escalation of military tensions. Last Tuesday, the U.S. Navy sailed a second ship through the South China Seas, challenging China's claim to the disputed waters. China's armed forces, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), said that it had expelled the first U.S. Naval ship, the USS Barry.The Chinese military's social media accused the U.S. of violating "international law and China's sovereignty and security interests" through "provocative acts," calling the sailing of ships "incompatible with the current joint efforts of the international community to fight against the Covid-19," according to the South China Morning Post."These provocative acts by the U.S. side ... seriously violated China's sovereignty and security interests, deliberately increased regional security risks and could easily trigger an unexpected incident."However, a Navy spokesperson denied that the PLA forced the USS Barry out of the disputed waters, telling Newsweek last Wednesday that "all interactions that occurred were in accordance with maritime norms."Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a prominent member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, joins task force response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx in their doubt of Trump and Pompeo's claim.In a Sunday appearance on CBS News' Face the Nation, Dr. Birx said the evidence is lacking to prove that the coronavirus epidemic began from an accident in the Wuhan laboratory.On April 28, Newsweek reported that NIAID funded scientists at the WIV and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses. The WIV's work on bat coronaviruses explains the Trump administration's focus on the lab as a possible culprit for the epidemic.In 2019, the NIAID provided backing for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to commit $3.7 million over six years to the WIV for research including some studies into gain-of-function. This money came after another $3.7 million, 5-year project for studying various bat coronaviruses. That project concluded in 2019. The NIH canceled the latest $3.7 million project on Friday, April 24, Politico reported.Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University, noted that the project description would've involved enhancing bat coronavirus to infect human cells and lab animals using genetic engineering techniques.Ebright and other scientists have opposed gain-of-function research because it risks the possibility of accidentally releasing the virus from a lab and creating a pandemic."Determining the molecular Achilles' heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected... [creating] a critical foundation for generating appropriate countermeasures and, ultimately, protecting the public health," Dr. Fauci and two co-authors wrote in a December 30, 2011 Washington Post article defending their work.

Their report comes as Germany prepares to ease its lockdown with museums, hairdressers, churches and more car factories beginning to reopen.It found one in five of those who had been infected with coronavirus reported no symptoms.The scientists analysed blood and nasal swabs from a sample of 919 people living in the town of Gangelt in the western region of Heinsberg, where people were infected in February while visiting a carnival.The hard-hit district has been described as Germany’s Wuhan and was considered ground zero of the country’s outbreak.The research was led by virologist Hendrink Streeck after his initial study was criticised.Professor Streeck said: “Whatever conclusions are pulled from the results of the study depends on many factors.“The evaluation of the findings and the conclusions for concrete decisions are the role of society and politics."Dr Martin Exner, head of Bonn’s Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, who co-authored the study, said: “Apparently, one in five infections occurs without noticeable symptoms, suggesting that infected persons who secrete virus and can infect others cannot be reliably identified on the basis of recognisable symptoms of the disease.“Every supposedly healthy person we encounter can unknowingly carry the virus. We must be aware of this and act accordingly.”Researchers arrived at their estimate by putting the town’s number of known coronavirus deaths relative to the largest estimate of local people with previous infections and applied the rate of 0.37 percent to country-wide deaths.Professor Gunther Hartmann said: “The results can help to further improve the models to calculate how the virus spreads. “So far the underlying data has been relatively weak.”Just over 900 people from 404 different households were tested as part of the study.The results showed around 15 percent testing positive for coronavirus, a figure five-times higher than the nationally reported rate.It also found that 22 percent of all infections people did not display any symptoms, including fevers and coughs.The findings are in line with similar studies in China and South Korea, where around a fifth of those infected reportedly do not realise they are carrying the disease.Armin Laschet, minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia, said the University of Bonn’s study is important in the future debate over the coronavirus.He said: “Streeck’s assumption that we have a high number of unreported cases has now been scientifically verified.”

A former senior North Korean diplomat has apologised for saying Kim Jong-un was likely so ill 'he cannot stand up by himself or walk properly' just three days before the dictator was seen smoking a cigarette at a public event.North Korea's former deputy ambassador to Britain, Thae Yong Ho, told CNN  Kim's 'abnormal' absence from a ruling party showpiece on April 15 signalled the dictator must be physically impaired. Thae fled to South Korea in 2016 and was one of two defectors elected to parliament last month. In a statement he said he felt 'blame and heavy responsibility' for making his unfounded claims.'I am aware that one of the reasons why many of you voted for me as a lawmaker is with the expectations of an accurate analysis and projections on North Korean issues', he said. 'Whatever the reasons, I apologise to everyone.' Kim disappeared from state media for weeks, sparking a flurry of speculation about his health and whereabouts, and worry about prospects for the nuclear-armed state in the event of an unexpected succession.But on Saturday, North Korean media published photographs of Kim at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.His re-emergence came as a blow to the credibility of some high-profile defectors from the North who had speculated that Kim was suffering from a grave illness or could even be dead.  The other prominent defector elected to parliament, Ji Seong-ho, said in a media interview he was 99 per cent certain that Kim had died after cardiovascular surgery and an official announcement would come as soon as Saturday.Ji, who was invited to attend US President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in 2018, could not be reached on Monday.On Friday he said he had received information about Kim's death from a source he could not disclose. He added he ran for office to bring attention to human rights abuse in the North.  South Korea's ruling Democratic Party criticised the pair for carelessness that it said could do more serious than just misinforming the public.One party member said they should be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees.Daily NK, a South Korean news outlet run by North Korean defectors, reported in April that Kim was recovering from a cardiovascular procedure, sparking international speculation about his health.But a senior South Korean government official told reporters today that the presidential office does not believe the authoritarian leader underwent an operation, according to the Yonhap News Agency.The news from South Korea came as the two neighbours exchanged gunfire along the border, just a day after Kim's reappearance.Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said he believed the timing of the 'grey area' provocation shows it could been planned to show that Kim was still in charge of the North Korean military. 'Yesterday, Kim was trying to show he is perfectly healthy, and today, Kim is trying to mute all kinds of speculation that he may not have full control over the military,' Choi said.'Rather than going all the way by firing missiles and supervising a missile launch, Kim could be reminding us, ''yes I'm healthy and I'm still in power''.' An unnamed senior official at the South's presidential office said: 'Chairman Kim is not believed to have received surgery.'There were media reports speculating about Kim's surgery, citing a change in the way he walks,' the official added, saying Seoul had enough grounds to draw the conclusion.    North Korean troops fired multiple gunshots towards the South in the Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula early on Sunday, prompting South Korean forces to fire back.The gunfire broke out between the two nations when North Korea fired a series of shots towards a guard post in South Korea that borders the North at 7.41am local time, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staffs (JCS) said.The JCS in Seoul said in a statement today that the guard post was hit by several shots from the North.Kim was last seen in public on April 11, when he presided over a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party in Pyongyang. On April 15, he inexplicably missed a Day of the Sun celebration honouring his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, the founder of North Korea. His unprecedented absence sparked a wave of speculation about his health, and he was not seen in public for 20 days.On Friday, May 1, the despot made his first public appearance after his absence, when he cut the ribbon at the opening of a fertiliser factory in Sunchon. Before Kim's reappearance, vice director of Hong Kong Satellite Television Shijian Xingzou claimed he was dead. Officials in South Korea and the US were sceptical.  The former top US diplomat for East Asia Daniel Russel said the pieces of the puzzle of Kim's disappearance would take time to assemble.His public appearance showed authoritative information about the well-being and whereabouts of a North Korean leader were very closely guarded, and rumours about him needed to be regarded with considerable skepticism, Russel said.The rumours had, however, served to focus attention on North Korea's succession plan, which 'in a monarchical and cult-like dictatorship is filled with risk, and the absence of a designated adult heir compounds that risk many times over,' Russel said.Earlier, a source familiar with US intelligence analyses and reporting said US agencies believed Kim was not ill and remained very much in power.'We think he's still in charge,' the source said on condition of anonymity. The source could not immediately confirm the KCNA report. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with Pyongyang, said it was plausible Kim was absent as a precaution over the coronavirus pandemic, in view of the stringent steps taken to head off an outbreak in the country.Harry Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said this still could be the case.He said: 'The most likely explanation for Kim's absence is with North Korea declaring the coronavirus pandemic an existential threat... he most likely was taking steps to ensure his health or may have been impacted in some way personally by the virus.'In his appearance at the fertiliser factory, Kim expressed satisfaction about the production system and said the plant made a significant contribution to the progress of the country's chemical industry and food production, KCNA said. Marks on Kim's wrist seen as he sat on a golf cart at the factory suggest he could have had heart surgery, medical experts claimed.  The experts assessed video footage of the visit and claimed marks on Kim's arms showed he has had a 'cardiovascular procedure', US-funded NK News reported.   What appeared to be needle marks could be seen on his wrists while he rode in a golf cart that looked a lot like the one he used in 2014, when he returned to the public eye with a cane after some time away. Asked about the KCNA report, US President Donald Trump said: 'I'd rather not comment on it yet. We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time.' Memes surfaced across social media in the West in response to the report that the dictator has been out and about.One said 'Kim Jong-Un with the best comeback of 2020', while another posted a picture comparing the dictator to the wrestler the Undertaker. A man wrote 'so Kim Jong-Un is alive and well' above a picture of Spiderman looking unsure.While another added 'North Korean state media release photo of Kim Jong-Un' with a picture a man being held up by two others.The news appears to fly in the face of a report earlier on Friday from a North Korean defector claiming he was '99 per cent sure' Kim was dead.Ji claimed to South Korea's Yonhap news agency he had been 'told Kim died last weekend' after cardiovascular surgery.The defector said Kim's sister Kim Yo-jong was in line to succeed her brother but said the secretive state was 'grappling with a complicated succession issue'. State-controlled media in North Korea had not provided any definitive proof Kim was alive.But there was a sign of life earlier on Friday as Daily NK reported the regime had issued a directive signed by Kim himself, the first in two weeks.Ji suggested Kim might have died after heart surgery. 'I've wondered how long he could have endured after cardiovascular surgery. I've been informed that Kim died last weekend,' he said.'It is not 100 per cent certain, but I can say the possibility is 99 per cent. North Korea is believed to be grappling with a complicated succession issue.'Pyongyang has never made any succession plans public, but experts say Kim's sister has been the most visible presence around the dictator in recent years.She was named an alternate member of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful Central Committee Politburo last month.North Korea is the world's most secretive country and reports about Kim and his family, including the suggestion he recently had heart surgery, are nearly impossible to verify.But other defectors have cast doubt on whether such sensitive information would ever leak out from Kim's inner circle.Some defectors say their relatives in North Korea did not know Kim had been missing from public view for three weeks.  One said people had been talking about Kim's whereabouts in very private circles after he failed to appear at the ruling party showpiece on April 15.Kim's unprecedented absence from the Day of the Sun ceremony honouring his grandfather prompted the major speculation about his welfare.Defector Lee Soon-hee said: 'I talked to my sister and my niece this morning and they had no clue about these reports and rumours about Kim Jong Un's health.'When I told them, they were so cautious about discussing it. North Koreans have a very limited knowledge of these things.' Lee defected to the South in 2009.North Koreans are keenly aware they could face punishment for discussing the Kim family, said Sokeel Park, of Liberty in North Korea, a group that works with defectors.He said: 'That doesn't mean people don't take that risk, some people do. But it's still a super sensitive issue. It's a little like the pope not showing up for Christmas,' he said of Kim's absence from the April 15 celebrations.South Korean officials say they have not detected any 'unusual movements' north of the demilitarised zone.The South's minister in charge of North Korean affairs said on Tuesday fear of coronavirus could have kept Kim away from the April 15 ceremony.President Trump said yesterday: 'I understand what is going on, I cannot just talk about him right now, just hoping that everything will be fine. But I do understand the situation very well'.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has said he was aware of reports on Kim's health and was paying close attention to developments.Still, experts said it was strange North Korea had not quickly release a picture of a healthy-looking Kim if there was no truth to the rumours.Official media has not provided any verifiable proof of life since April 11, other than reporting he had sent messages to North Korean workers and to South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa and the pictures of him in Sunchon.The other defector, Thae,  warned only a small handful of people would know the full story.He also cautioned clues about Kim's whereabouts - such as an apparent sighting of his personal train in the city of Wonsan - could be deliberate diversion tactics.Pyongyang officials know the train can be seen from satellites and have previously sent it around the country to confuse outsiders, Thae said.The sighting of the train was followed by further satellite images from Wonsan showing boats often used by Kim and his entourage.North Korea has never announced who would succeed Kim Jong Un in the event he is incapacitated and with no details known about his young children, analysts say his sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.Each change at the top in North Korea has raised the prospect of a leadership vacuum or collapse of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.So far, each of the three Kims to rule North Korea has defied expectations, holding on to power with an iron grip.But under Kim Jong Un, North Korea's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles has grown substantially, raising concerns over who would control them.In the event of any leadership transition, Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo Jong is likely to play a central part.In the past two years, Yo Jong has risen quickly through North Korea's leadership hierarchy, serving officially as a vice director of the Workers' Party's powerful Central Committee, but also unofficially as her brother's chief of staff.Kim Yo Jong, who is believed to be 31, has a firm control of key party functions, setting herself to be the main source of power behind a collective leadership.She has regularly been observed at her brother's side, leading South Korean Media to dub her the 'Ivanka Trump of North Korea'.'Kim Yo Jong will be for the time being the main power base with control of the organisation and guidance department, the judiciary and public security,' said Cho Han-bum of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government-funded think-tank in Seoul.Still, relatively little is known of of Kim Yo Jong. The dictator's younger sibling has routinely kept a low profile, having only made her first public statement last month, in which she mocked South Korea as being a 'frightening dog barking', for opposing a live-fire military demonstration.But sources say Yo Jong's work behind the scenes suggests she would rule with the same iron-fist as her predecessors, should she be announced leader, temporarily or otherwise.Along with several other North Korean officials, Kim Yo Jong was blacklisted by the US Treasury Department for 'severe human rights abuses' in 2017.She also incurred a reputation for her aggressive propaganda pushing, regarded a one of the main officials who worked to enact 'rigid censorship policies and conceals its inhumane and oppressive behavior'.'Among the North's power elite, Kim Yo Jong has the highest chance to inherit power, and I think that possibility is more than 90 per cent,' an analyst said.Yo Jong first began working in the ruling party in 2007, but in the last few years she has 'gotten a lot more serious' about the role she's playing, government consultant Michael Madden told the New Yorker.'When you see footage of her on the receiving lines, she is smiling, a nice friendly young woman, but when she is out of those lines, the smile vanishes and she even looks like Kim Jong Il,' Madden remarked.Should she be announced as ruler, Yo Jong would become North Korea's first female leader since her Grandfather Kim Il-Sung founded the nation in 1948.   In the event of Kim Jong Un's death, party Elders Choe Ryong Hae and Pak Pong Ju would likely find themselves at Yo Jong's side, helping to weather any leadership storm.Ryong Hae was announced as North Korea's nominal head of state last when he rose to become president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, following decades of service within the party for the ruing Kim family.Choe and Pak Pong Ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North's push to introduce more free-market functions to revive its economy, are likely to be the figureheads leading a collective leadership, analysts say.Unlikely to emerge as a major presence is Kim Jong Un's estranged older brother, Kim Jong Chol, who has not been a part of the country's leadership instead opting for a quite life away from politics playing music.Though according to North Korea's former deputy ambassador in London, who has since defected to the South, Jong Chol does maintain ties with his siblings and could play a more public role in any contingency plans.Kim Jong Un is believed to have three children with Ri Sol Ju, the youngest born in 2017, according to the South's National Intelligence Service.The oldest is a 10-year-old son, meaning any of the three would need the assistance of their relatives or political guardians if they were to become a fourth-generation hereditary leader.Kim Jong Il had been groomed for 20 years to lead the country, while Kim Jong Un had just over a year to prepare, due to his father's sudden death from a heart attack.Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said: 'Kim Yo Jong is unlikely to take over the helm but could help build a caretaker regime as a power broker until the kids grow up, and Kim Jong Chol might return to help for a while.'This is not the first time Kim has disappeared from the public eye. In 2014, Kim was not seen for 40 days, before he reemerged appearing to walk with a limp and using a cane, after he reportedly suffered from an ankle problem.His father Kim Jong-il disappeared from view for months in 2008, prompting speculation that he had a stroke. A French doctor later confirmed the reports, and the then leader died three years later.But North Korea's ruling elite have vanished from the spotlight before prompting rumors of their death only to re-emerge seemingly unscathed.In 2015 it was claimed by a North Korean defector Kim ordered his own aunt to be killed by poison. The aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, re-appeared smiling in January.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea last month, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier last month Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Kim's whereabouts or condition.North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather - an important anniversary in North Korea.Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea's chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by U.N. sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea's nuclear arsenal.'The North Korean version of Undertaker': Internet reacts to claims Kim Jong-un is alive after photos of dictator are released for the first time in 20 days following rumours he had diedTwitter users rejoiced following the return to public life of North Korean despot Kim Jong-un. Several reports from the hermit state suggested Kim, who is believed to be in his late 30s, could have undergone major surgery or even possibly died.  He had not been seen in public since April 11 and missed the national celebrations for his grandfather and founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung on April 15. However, North Korea's state news agency KCNA released photographs of a smiling Kim inspecting a fertiliser plant outside Pyongyang. The report said Kim cut a ribbon as the crowd 'burst into thunderous cheers of 'hurrah!' for the Supreme Leader...'. Twitter users questioned the authenticity of the photographs, with memes ripped from The Simpsons and Weekend at Bernies.  Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ribbon-cutting ceremony and also touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.Many in the large crowd of people, described as officials of the army, the ruling party and the community who worked on the project, were wearing face masks and standing some distance from the podium where Kim and his aides took part in the ceremony.North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus and has said it has been taking tough measures to prevent an outbreak. One reason for Kim's absence has been the suggestion he may have been taking precautions against coronavirus.Kim was accompanied by senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong and top aides vice-chairman Pak Pong Ju of the State Affairs Commission and cabinet premier Kim Jae Ryong, and KCNA said.Asked about the KCNA report on Kim, U.S. President Donald Trump said: 'I'd rather not comment on it yet.''We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time,' he told reporters at the White House. Speculation about Kim's health has been rife after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.He last made a public appearance on April 11 attending a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party politburo.Following his absence from the anniversary, a South Korean news outlet specialising on the North reported that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. A flurry of other unconfirmed reports about his condition and his whereabouts followed.Officials in South Korea and the United States expressed scepticism about the reports.State TV footage on Saturday showed Kim's leg movements appearing stiff and jerky and one of the images showed a green golf cart in the background, similar to one he used in 2014 after a lengthy public absence.       
Gretchen Whitmer says heavily armed men and Confederate flags at state capitol ‘depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history’Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan issued a rebuke of the armed protesters who gathered inside the state capitol last week in defiance of statewide lockdown orders, saying the demonstrators embodied some of the “worst racism” of the nation’s history.“Some of the outrageousness of what happened at our capitol depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country,” Whitmer said during a Sunday interview on CNN’s State of the Union.Last week Donald Trump had said of the protesters: “These are very good people.”Hundreds of protesters, many not wearing protective face masks and some armed legally with “long guns”, gathered inside the statehouse in Lansing on Thursday as lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The tightly packed crowd attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists.Whitmer highlighted that the number of protesters was relatively small but that the imagery some of them used was a disturbing reminder of ugly elements of America’s past. “We know that people are not all happy about having to take the stay-home posture,” Whitmer said on Sunday, “and you know what, I’m not either. But we have to listen to the public health experts and displays like the one we saw in our state capitol are not representative of who we are in Michigan.“There were swastikas and Confederate flags and nooses and people with assault rifles. That’s a small group of people when you think that this is a state of almost 10 million people, the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing.”Displaying the Confederate flag, or other symbols of the slave-owning south during the American civil war, is usually seen as racist. While some claim they are celebrating southern identity, it is widely seen as a racist symbol deeply offensive to black Americans. There is also an ongoing campaign to remove Confederate war statues from public display or rename streets and buildings which commemorate Confederate generals or politicians.Last week, the Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who represents Michigan’s 13th congressional district, condemned the demonstrations at the state Capitol. “Black people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten State Legislators and staff,” Tlaib wrote in a tweet on Thursday.The protests continued to draw national attention on Friday when Trump once again threw his support behind the rightwing movement, saying Whitmer should “make a deal” with the demonstrators.“The governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” the president wrote on Twitter. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.”When asked if it was appropriate for the president to express support for protests in which “long guns” were carried on Friday afternoon, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said the president supported the right to protest within the law and while following federal social distancing guidelines.“The president says that we must protest lawfully and act within the bounds of the law,” said McEnany.The staggering effects of the pandemic among Whitmer’s electorate in terms of both illness and unemployment have placed a nationwide focus on Michigan, which is certain to be a key battleground state in the upcoming presidential election. The state had long been regarded as a Democratic stronghold but went for Trump four years ago, helping to spring his surprise electoral victory.
GALLUP, N.M. — All the roads into this city on the edge of the Navajo Nation are closed. The soldiers at the checkpoints have their orders: Outsiders must turn around and drive away.Cities across the country have closed down businesses and ordered residents to remain at home, but the threat of the coronavirus in Gallup became so serious last week that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham invoked the state’s Riot Control Act to lock down the entire city. The downtown of shops, bars and Indian trading posts is now nearly deserted.“We’re scared to death, so this had to be done,” said Amber Nez, 27, a shoe store saleswoman and Navajo Nation citizen who lives in Gallup and is pregnant with her fourth child. “I only wonder why we didn’t do this sooner.”The lockdown comes as state and local authorities grapple with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the United States on the nearby Navajo Nation, the country’s largest Indian reservation, and a surge in detected cases in places near the reservation.As of Sunday, the Navajo Nation had reported a total of 2,373 cases and 73 confirmed deaths from the virus. With a rate of 46 deaths per 100,000 people, the tribal nation has a higher coronavirus death rate than every state in the country except New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts.While Gallup is not within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation, the city of 22,000 serves as a regional hub for the Navajo and nearby Native American pueblos. Many citizens of various tribal nations regularly drive into Gallup to buy food and other goods.The refusal to follow social distancing guidelines by some residents of Gallup and other so-called border towns near the reservation has emerged as a source of tension, as tribal authorities say the behavior is undermining their attempts to control the virus.The Gallup area had the third-highest rate of infection of any metropolitan area in the United States as of Sunday. Only the areas around New York City and Marion, Ohio, the site of a large prison cluster, had higher rates.McKinley County, which includes Gallup, now accounts for about 30 percent of all confirmed coronavirus cases in New Mexico, surpassing counties in the state with much larger populations.In addition to shutting down all roads into Gallup, including the exits off the interstate highway, the lockdown order directs the essential businesses that are still operating to close from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. Nonessential businesses remain entirely closed in Gallup, as they are in other parts of New Mexico.The order also prohibits residents from leaving their homes except for emergency or essential outings, and allows only two people in vehicles at a time.Soldiers from the New Mexico National Guard were stationed at some of the checkpoints into Gallup on Sunday. Dusty Francisco, a spokesman for the New Mexico State Police, said the agency had sent 32 officers to assist. Mayor Louis Bonaguidi, who requested the lockdown, said he understood that the ask was unusual. “However, the Covid-19 outbreak in the city of Gallup is a crisis of the highest order,” Mr. Bonaguidi said. “Immediate action is necessary.”Mr. Bonaguidi on Sunday requested an extension of the lockdown, and the governor has extended it until Thursday.Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation, said he fully supported the lockdown order. “We have many members of the Navajo Nation that reside in Gallup and many that travel in the area, and their health and safety is always our top priority,” Mr. Nez said.Before the lockdown, tribal leaders complained that their attempts to curb infections on the reservation by setting curfews and creating checkpoints were being undermined when Navajo citizens ventured into Gallup.Residents of Gallup also groused that many people were ignoring social distancing guidelines by crowding into vehicles and food stores.The riot control law invoked by the governor allows police to issue misdemeanor citations for first-time violators. Repeat offenders could face felony charges.Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lujan Grisham, said that the governor’s legal advisers were not aware of the riot law being used before in the state.But state officials said they were responding to building concern about the potential for the virus to devastate Native American peoples. While New Mexico has largely succeeded in limiting the overall spread of the virus around much of the state, the transmission levels among Native Americans remain alarming.Native Americans account for 53 percent of New Mexico’s confirmed coronavirus cases, while making up about 11 percent of the state’s population. Epidemiologists list several contributing factors, including multiple generations living in single households on reservations and a shortage of running water, making basic hygiene difficult.The fight to curb the spread of the virus in Gallup comes at a time of anger over the Trump administration’s failure to distribute the billions of dollars in coronavirus relief allocated to tribes in the $2.2 trillion stimulus package.Tribes including the Navajo Nation are suing the Treasury Department over its decision to allow for-profit native corporations in Alaska, in which Native Alaskans hold shares, to access the federal relief. The suit argues that the decision effectively diminishes the pool of money available to tribes in their fight against the virus.While the tribes spar with the federal government, Gallup stands in contrast to some towns in New Mexico where elected officials are adopting defiant positions against social distancing measures. In the nearby town of Grants, also located near tribal nations in western New Mexico, the mayor openly defied Ms. Lujan Grisham last week by telling businesses to reopen. (The state Supreme Court has ordered the mayor, Martin Hicks, to obey the state orders.)Mr. Hicks has asserted that Navajos were to blame for spreading the virus, openly expressing an unsubstantiated position that seems to be gaining traction in towns near Native American reservations.“We didn’t take it to them, they brought it to us,” Mr. Hicks said in a telephone interview, without offering any proof. “So how are we going to spread it amongst them when they’re the ones that brought it to us?”Meanwhile, some in Gallup are fretting over the potential for increased transmission across the state line as businesses in nearby Arizona prepare to reopen.Linda Alonzo, the postmaster, said that the lockdown was “absolutely needed.”“You’d go into Walmart, the parking lot was full, people weren’t doing much distancing,” said Ms. Alonzo, who emphasized that she had not left her home since the lockdown began.“We needed something extreme,” she said, “and this was it.”

Coronavirus deaths in care homes are not inevitable, a report has warned amid fears the killer virus has claimed the lives of thousands of Britain's most vulnerable. Researchers at the London School of Economics have highlighted exactly where the UK has fallen short of protecting some 400,000 care home residents and staff. More than 5,000 care home residents have died from COVID-19. Official data shows care home deaths account for more than a third of all fatalities. The LSE report highlights how the UK Government's response has been different to other countries, taking a reactive approach rather than precautionary measures to prevent an outbreak.  In contrast, Hong Kong - which took action to prevent a crisis early on - has recorded no official deaths in care homes.In some cases, swab tests have been limited to six residents with symptoms per care home, forcing staff to make assumptions on who may have the killer infection.Carers are allowed to continue working even if they have had contact with a positive case, while in Germany a 14-day self isolation period is compulsory. In South Korea, where total and care home deaths have been relatively low, regular temperature checks are taken of residents. A fever is one of the tell-tale symptoms. Similarly in Hong Kong, residents are self-isolating even if there is no outbreak and must wear a face mask if they leave their room.   Adelina Comas-Herrera, an author of the report, said she expects the UK number of deaths of care home residents to amount to half of all deaths, as is happening in France, Belgium and Canada. The pattern has been reported in Spain and Italy - where governments were slow to act and were underprepared for the pandemic with low levels of PPE - but the data is not as reliable.Ms Comas-Herrera, an assistant professorial research fellow in the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, has been gathering resources worldwide to create LTCcovid.LTCcovid (Long-Term Care responses to COVID-19) will document the impact of COVID-19 in care settings over the course of the pandemic.Its most recent report said: 'While it is early to come to firm conclusions and there are many difficulties with data, these differences suggest that having large numbers of deaths as result of COVID-19 is not inevitable and that appropriate measures to prevent and control infections in care homes can save lives.' LTCcovid collection of information finds that countries that appear to have had relative success in preventing COVID-19 entering care homes have very strict processes to isolate and test all care home residents and staff.They don't just focus on those who have symptoms, but anyone who may have had contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19. At least in the UK, timely and systematic testing of care home residents and staff has been lacking. It has come to light that testing was initially done on the first five symptomatic residents, meaning potentially several more would have gone untested. Testing capacity has been and is still very limited since the start, so priorities lie with people in hospitals and NHS workers. Care homes have to decide who to isolate based on assumptions of who has the illness, leaving others to mingle with each other while following social distancing rules. But 'there is also growing evidence of asymptomatic transmission in care homes, which highlights the importance of regular testing in care homes instead of relying on symptoms to identify people with potential COVID-19 infections', Ms Comas-Herreras writes.'Geriatricians are also raising concerns that, among care home residents, the symptoms of COVID-19 may not be the typical cough and fever that is covered in the guidance documents for care homes in many countries, but that a range of other symptoms (such as delirium, diarrhoea, lethargy, falls and reduced appetite) are more frequent among care home residents with COVID-19.'Current guidelines in the UK only require the isolation of residents and staff who are symptomatic. Similar guidelines were in place in Spain until the 24th of March.But the World Health Organization's guidelines insist on isolation of residents and staff who are suspected to have COVID-19. The Government has been slated for its lack of support to nursing homes, with no routine testing available, no up-to-date records of the number of people infected or dead, and 'paltry' attempts to deliver adequate protective clothing for staff. The South Korean approach has been robust, albeit potentially distressing for care home residents.Any resident that displays symptoms of COVID-19 enter quarantine facilities such as the Human Resources Development Institute and the English Learning Campus, both in Seoul. Care workers clean their room and the resident can only return once they have tested negative after a two-week isolation period. Authorities acted fast to prevent outbreaks if there were a spike in cases in the community.In Gyungsang-do, the region with the second highest recorded rate of COVID-19 cases in South Korea, 564 care homes were quarantined to prevent the virus entering the home, local media report.Staff were stopped from leaving the facility for two weeks with financial incentives to keep them going.   Ms Comas-Herrera said Germany was 'an outlier' in Europe owing to its proactive stance on testing and stricter guidelines on discharging elderly patients from hospital, The Times reports.   States across Germany have reacted differently to control infection in care homes, with measures ranging from quarantining COVID-19 patients at separate facilities to compulsory wearing of face masks by staff when entering residents' rooms. Meanwhile the Italian government acted late on the COVID-19 outbreak management in nursing homes, restricting visitations after the lockdown when thousands were already infected in the population.  It's difficult to compare death rates of COVID-19 in care homes because there are differences in how deaths are recorded, how data is published and testing. There have been large numbers of deaths in care homes in Italy, Spain, the UK and the US but official data for these countries is either incomplete or difficult to interpret, LSE say. The percentage of COVID-related deaths - suspected or confirmed - among care home residents ranges from 19 per cent in the UK to 62 per cent in Canada, where care homes have been hard hit. The lower total deaths a country has, the lower the care home deaths tends to be.  For example in Singapore, two per cent of its 18 deaths have been in care homes.There have been no infections or deaths in care homes in Hong Kong - only four deaths in total and 1,040 cases of infections in the total population.  Singapore, where there are 18,700 cases, there has been relative success at preventing infection from reaching care homes, LTC Covid report.Data for Germany suggests that 36 per cent of deaths would have happened in communal establishments. This includes care homes, prisons and other group living settings. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides weekly updates of deaths registered in England and Wales. But there is a delay in reporting because the ONS figures are slower to prepare. They have to be certified by a doctor, registered and processed. The most recent report said there were 22,351 deaths registered in England and Wales involving COVID-19 up until April 17.Three quarters (75 per cent) occurred in hospitals, 19 per cent (4,168) in care homes and five per cent (1,083) in private homes.  Deaths in the week April 11-17 were double the five year average, according to an ONS analysis showed.  National Records of Scotland (NRS) publishes a weekly analysis of death registrations which mention COVID-19 on the death certificate.Of the 2,272 deaths that occurred in all settings up until April 26, 886 COVID-19 deaths occurred in care homes - a rate of 39 per cent.  Thousands of care home deaths are reported weeks after they occur, according to ONS data. Experts fear that because of this, the sheer scale of the problem in UK homes is misunderstood. Ms Comas-Herrera said it is currently complicated to understand how many COVID-19 deaths have occurred among care home residents because they might also be included in hospital death data, if that is where they died.But Ms Comas-Herrera said she expects the UK will see care home deaths reach 50 per cent, similar to France where official data records 51 per cent, and Canada. Although it seems we have reached a peak in hospital deaths, she is not sure whether we have reached the peak in care homes deaths. Her thoughts echo other experts. Last week, Sir David Spiegelhalter, a highly regarded statistics expert and an OBE recipient, said he believes the numbers of care home deaths are still climbing as Government statistics show hospital fatalities are trailing off.He spoke of a 'massive, unprecedented spikes' in the number of people dying in nursing homes.Care Quality Commission (CQC) reports suggest care homes are now seeing around 400 coronavirus deaths each day, on average - a number on par with hospitals in England.Government ministers, pressured on claims they didn't do enough to help care homes, insist they were 'not overlooked' while they scrambled to protect the NHS from collapsing.   While warnings about hospitals sparked a 'protect the NHS' mantra and a rush to buy ventilators and free up beds, nursing homes saw no such efforts. Britain's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, revealed he and other senior scientists warned politicians 'very early on' about the risk COVID-19 posed to care homes.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has been meeting approximately twice a week since its first coronavirus discussion on January 22.Sir Patrick, who chairs the group along with Professor Chris Whitty, said they had 'flagged' the risk of care home and hospital outbreaks at the start of the epidemic. Environment Secretary George Eustice said on April 29 'we have always recognised there was more vulnerability there'. He denied that more testing would have saved lives. The number of residents dying of any cause has almost tripled in a month, from around 2,500 per week in March to 7,300 in a single week in April - more than 2,000 of the latter were confirmed COVID-19 cases.

For an explanation of our Advertising Policy, visit this page.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, United Airlines has adjusted the passenger experience to maximise social distancing and minimise your interactions with other people.Specifically, the Chicago-based carrier has started back-to-front boarding, curtailed most of its inflight food and beverage service and implemented new and improved cabin sanitisation protocols, though it continues to fall short of peers Alaska, Delta and Southwest, which are capping passenger bookings to guarantee extra space.Last week UA joined most major U.S. carriers in requiring that passengers wear face coverings in line with Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines.On Monday, the carrier updated its Contract of Carriage to include a new provision around the customers that it can refuse to transport.Specifically, the following bolded changes were made to the section around passenger safety:Passengers who are incapable of completing a flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight, and Passengers who appear to have symptoms of or have a communicable disease (or there is reason to believe there was exposure to a communicable disease) or other condition that could pose a direct threat to the health or safety of themselves or others on the flight, or who refuse a medical screening for such disease or condition, whether suspected or actual.This update to the conditions of flying with United specifically allow the carrier to refuse transport if it has “reason to believe” that you were exposed to the coronavirus. These changes permit United to remove you solely based on its suspicion.In explaining these changes, a United spokesperson exclusively told TPG that “this update was made to help us better protect the health and safety of our customers and crew, and was made in line with our new requirement that all United employees and passengers wear a face covering while onboard the aircraft that went into effect May 4”.It’ll be interesting to see how (and if) these new changes take effect. Perhaps the carrier is setting itself up to have a legal basis to deny carriage to those who don’t submit themselves to airport coronavirus testing.As airlines look to recover from the pandemic, they’re attempting to reassure the flying public that it’s once again safe to take to the skies. Mandated, on-the-spot coronavirus testing could become a thing of the future, much like airport security.Emirates has already implemented COVID-19 testing on select flights. Passengers are all screened before departure to ensure that no one onboard is carrying the virus.Additionally, many countries don’t want to see a second wave of coronavirus cases. For instance, Austria has a policy that states that arriving passengers must go into a 14-day quarantine if they don’t present a health certificate showing a negative COVID-19 test result that’s no more than four days old. If you don’t have a recent COVID-19 test, the Vienna airport now offers on-demand testing to help you avoid a quarantine.As United begins to ramp up international travel, some of its destinations may require COVID-19 testing. The update to the Contract of Carriage allows the carrier to require such testing in order to be permitted to board, even if the carrier only has “reason to believe” you might carry the disease.This wasn’t the only change to be included in the Contract of Carriage. United also formalized its face covering mandate by adding a clause to the list of passengers that it can refuse:Passengers who refuse to wear a mask or face covering while at the airport and/or onboard UA and United Express flights if UA or United Express believe, in their sole discretion, that a failure to wear such a mask or facial covering may pose a risk to the health or safety of others.All in all, we’re living in unprecedented times. It might not be too long before you’re required to take a COVID-19 test in order to board a United flight. 
New York City will distribute 7.5 million free cloth and non-medical face coverings immediately to further prevent the spread of Covid-19, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Monday. New Yorkers have overwhelmingly complied with Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order requiring all residents to wear face coverings when in public, de Blasio said at his daily press briefing. To further comply with the order and prevent the spread of the virus, the city will distribute 5 million three-ply non-medical masks and 2.5 million cloth face coverings citywide, including at grocery stores, parks, meal sites and other city locations. “Wherever you turn, you’re going to be offered a face covering, and it’s going to be on an ongoing basis for weeks to come to make sure everyone has what they need,” de Blasio said. The face coverings will not be the same as the city’s health-care workers use but are still effective as long as they remain dry, de Blasio said. He added that for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak in March, the city will have enough personal protective equipment this upcoming week for its hospitals. De Blasio also said he is sending more than 1.9 million surgical masks to nursing homes across the five boroughs. “We can finally ensure for the whole week ahead that every hospital and every nursing home will get what they need,” de Blasio said. All three indicators the city uses to track the spread of Covid-19 were down on Monday, de Blasio said. The daily number of people admitted to the hospital for suspected Covid-19 dipped below 100, and the number of people currently in New York City Health and Hospitals’ intensive care stood at 632, down from 645 people as of May 1, he said. Approximately 17% of people citywide tested positive for Covid-19, down from 20%. “This is the kind of day we had been waiting for, and it’s a beautiful thing. Let’s put together some more like it, and that’s our pathway to something better,” de Blasio said. The city has been conducting about 13,000 tests per day, which is “definitely progress” compared with weeks prior, de Blasio said. While there are still a “substantial number of new cases each day,” he said that the city is starting to see the numbers decline as testing capacity increases. “I think it means the strategies are working, that we’re going to stick to them, and that we’re only going to let up very carefully and in a very steady fashion to not allow that resurgence or that boomerang,” de Blasio said.  
Sony has identified the people behind The Last of Us: Part 2 leak, confirming that they are not affiliated with developer Naughty Dog in any way.Last week, footage revealing story spoilers emerged online. The leaks included cut scenes that reveal important plot points, as well as the game's ending.At first, it was suggested that a disgruntled Naughty Dog employee was behind the leak, but those rumours have now been dismissed.In a statement made to Polygon, Sony said it has identified the leakers and an investigation is currently underway."SIE has identified the primary individuals responsible for the unauthorized release of TLOU2 assets. They are not affiliated with Naughty Dog or SIE. We are unable to comment further because the information is subject to an on-going investigation," read the statement."We’re looking forward to when The Last of Us Part II will be in your hands and can’t wait for you to enjoy the full experience on June 19."Additionally, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who claims to have spoken to people with direct knowledge of how the footage was leaked, has suggested hackers are responsible."Hackers found a security vulnerability in a patch for an older ND game and used it to get access to ND’s servers," he tweeted earlier today (May 3).Following the leak, Naughty Dog said in a statement: "We know the last few days have been incredibly difficult for you."We feel the same. It's disappointing to see the release and sharing of pre-release footage from development. Do your best to avoid spoilers and we ask that you don't spoil it for others."The Last of Us Part II will be in your hands soon. No matter what you see and hear, the final experience will be worth it." 
THE Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove says he hopes around 80,000 people on the Isle of Wight will download a trial app, designed to trace and track symptoms of coronavirus via our smartphones.The Isle of Wight’s MP Bob Seely is hoping that half of the Isle of Wight’s residents will download and use the app during its trial on the Island this week.Michael Gove told the daily press briefing yesterday (Sunday): “It is one arrow in the quiver. The more people who download the app the better”, saying it would be one of a series of measures designed to help the country move forward. Transport secretary Grant Shapps had earlier revealed the plans for the Isle of Wight trial, on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.This morning, it is reported that the app is anonymous and will not store personal data.Using bluetooth, it will detect if the user has been in contact with someone else who has the app and has used it to report having coronavirus symptoms.The app has not yet been made available to download.Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he welcomed the trial: “If we can get up to near 50 percent of Islanders using this app, we could be the first place to get rid of this wretched virus in the UK, because we will be hunting it down.”On the Isle of Wight, 127 people have tested positive for Covid-19.In all, 28 peope have died.Council Leader Dave Stewart said: "I am very pleased we can be the first place to use this new digital technology in the country. "People who have been in contact with symptomatic individuals will be identified much earlier than is currently the case, and they will be provided with advice so they can act appropriately to protect themselves and our community.“I really do think this is an amazing opportunity for the Isle of Wight and one I know residents will join with me in embracing.”Concerns have been raised about the security and privacy of people using the app.Isle of Wight Councillor Andrew Garratt warned it should be ‘ethical’ and called for more information about what is being tested, collected and stored. He asked on Twitter what security measures were in place and what will happen if someone wants to stop using it.Dominic Minghella, who has survived coronavirus and written about his experience, said he has concerns about security. Meanwhile, Islanders responded yesterday to claims by The Spectator magazine, over the weekend, that the Isle of Wight was not technologically geared up for the app.Chair of the Isle of Wight Conservative Association, David Pugh called the claim 'absolute nonsense' and Labour’s Richard Quigley called it ‘irksome’. 
NASA satellites have provided more data than ever before on what has been happening to Antarctica and Greenland's ice over the past 16 years with dire, if not entirely unexpected, findings. Both polar ice sheets are losing billions of tonnes of ice every year and adding to sea-level rise.The results revealed that although there are small gains of ice in East Antarctica, they have been dwarfed by massive losses in West Antarctica, NASA reported. The net ice mass loss has led to almost half an inch of sea-level rise between 2003 and 2019 - just under a third of the total sea-level rise around the world in that time.The findings were based on information from the space agency’s ICESat and ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeters - devices that use laser pulses to measure the elevation and thickness of ice sheets and help better understand global climate change.The researchers concluded that ice masses from both Greenland and Antarctica will continue to contribute to sea level rise increasing over the next few decades. Greenland’s ice sheet lost an average of 200 gigatons of ice per year, and Antarctica’s ice sheet lost an average of 118 gigatons of ice per year, NASA reported.One gigaton of ice would cover New York’s Central Park in ice more than 1,000 feet thick, to a height taller than the Chrysler Building, NASA said."Quantifying changes in Earth’s ice sheets, and identifying the climate drivers, is central to improving sea-level projections," the researchers stated.The researchers believe that "competing climate processes" are going on in the Antarctic. Antarctica and Greenland are losing ice mass overall, but it is accumulating in some regions while disappearing from others.In Greenland and Antarctica, "losses outpaced gains", with West Antarctica’s losses accounting for over 30 pr cent of the region’s total. It was somewhat compensated in East Antarctica, where ice sheets were gaining mass from accumulated snow.

Over the last few weeks many of us have been stunned by the sight of Starlink satellites.Lots of people have stayed up specifically to catch a glimpse of the dazzling lights passing through the sky during the lockdown period.And the formations are due to be visible again over the coming days.Comprised of thousands of tiny satellites the formations look like stars moving across the night sky – like a train.The technology is used across the globe to provide remote locations with low-cast internet and are the latest to be launched by entrepreneur Elon Musk's company - SpaceX.But they might well become a relatively common sight in the skies above the UK in the future as SpaceX have been granted 12,000 satellites as part of the project - a number which could eventually increase to 30,000.When will I be able to see the Starlink satellites?According to Findastarlink.com, the formations will be visible on multiple occasions in the UK over the next few days.Here’s when they say the best times are to catch them over the north-east of England.May 411:01 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for six minutes travelling west to east.May 510:02 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for five minutes travelling southwest to east.May 610:38 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for six minutes travelling west to east.May 79:38 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for six minutes travelling southwest to east. 
Fifteen books were recognized as winners or finalists for the Pulitzer Prize on Monday, in the categories of fiction, general history, biography, poetry and general nonfiction.FictionWinner: “The Nickel Boys,” by Colson WhiteheadIn his latest novel, the “Underground Railroad” writer fictionalized the story of a Florida school where dozens of black boys were tortured and buried in a secret graveyard. “Were Whitehead’s only aim to shine an unforgiving light on a redacted chapter of racial terrorism in the American chronicle, that would be achievement enough,” wrote our reviewer. But Whitehead “applies a master storyteller’s muscle not just to excavating a grievous past but to examining the process by which Americans undermine, distort, hide or ‘neatly erase’ the stories he is driven to tell.”Finalist: “The Dutch House,” by Ann PatchettThis novel explores the dynamics of a blended family living in a glass house outside Philadelphia in midcentury. “I can’t pluck out one sentence worth quoting, but how effective they are when woven together — these translucent lines that envelop you like a spider’s web,” wrote our reviewer. “It can feel old-fashioned: her style, her attachment to a very traditional kind of storytelling,” but “like the family’s Dutch house, it’s an enduring structure, which gives an added dimension to the references in the text — its way of gesturing toward a lineage.”Finalist: “The Topeka School,” by Ben LernerLerner’s “exhilarating” novel, also selected by the Book Review as one of the 10 best books of 2019, features a familiar protagonist to his readers, Adam Gordon, this time as a high school student. Lerner’s questions about art and authenticity are carried through to this book, but in “The Topeka School,” “Adam’s faithlessness can no longer be written off as cosmopolitan neurosis. It is instead a symptom of a national crisis of belief, in which structures of understanding crumble and ‘regimes of meaning collapse into the spread.’”HistoryWinner: “Sweet Taste of Liberty: A True Story of Slavery and Restitution in America,” by W. Caleb McDanielThis book explores reparations through the story of a 19th-century woman who sued her captor after surviving a kidnapping and re-enslavement. Her story, wrote McDaniel in an Opinion piece for The Times, “offers lessons for today, both about the impact restitution can make and about the limited power of payment alone.”Finalist: “Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership,” by Keeanga-Yamahtta TaylorTaylor’s book, also longlisted for the National Book Award, “covers the few years in the late ’60s and early ’70s, when the Fair Housing Act of 1968 nominally ended the government’s longstanding practice of redlining.” Our reviewer wrote that she “meticulously documents what happened next, as the federal government partnered with a real estate industry, enthusiastic about exploiting a new market but refusing to bear most of the risk.”Finalist: “The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America,” by Greg GrandinIn this “measured, careful work,” Grandin explores the recently popularized symbol of the border wall in the context of the United States’s historical Western expansion. “Grandin keeps his cool — he prefers the stiletto to the club — but he grows angrier as his history reaches the present day,” wrote our reviewer.BiographyWinner: “Sontag: Her Life and Work,” by Benjamin MoserThis biography of Susan Sontag “is a skilled, lively, prodigiously researched book that, in the main, neither whitewashes nor rebukes its subject: It works hard to make the reader see Sontag as the severely complex person she was,” wrote our reviewer.Finalist: “Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century,” by George PackerAccording to our reviewer, “Our Man” — a biography as “charming, brilliant, cocksure and exasperating” as its subject, the American diplomat Richard Holbrooke — “isn’t a book you’re supposed to dip into piecemeal, searching for information; it’s best appreciated like a novel, consumed whole.”Finalist: “Parisian Lives: Samuel Beckett, Simone de Beauvoir, And Me,” by Deirdre BairBair’s book “reads much like a ‘making of …’ documentary” in which she “gives us her off-camera take on her first two biographies,” wrote our reviewer. Both Beckett and de Beauvoir agreed to the project, with different levels of participation, and the book delves into the sometimes difficult path of writing about the two figures.PoetryWinner: “The Tradition,” by Jericho BrownIn this project, “Brown creates poetry that is a catalog of injuries past and present, personal and national, in a country where blackness, particularly male blackness, is akin to illness,” wrote our reviewer. “Even as he reckons seriously with our state of affairs, Brown brings a sense of semantic play to blackness, bouncing between different connotations of words to create a racial doublespeak.”Finalist: “Dunce,” by Mary RuefleRuefle “confronts the extraordinary yet banal fact that all of us die,” in this poetry collection. “‘Dunce’ is full of these linguistic reversals — the chiasmus may be the device that best represents life’s reversal of fortune, our built-in obsolescence,” wrote our reviewer.Finalist: “Only as the Day Is Long: New and Selected Poems,” by Dorianne LauxThis collection of poems by a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet includes 20 new pieces that are odes to Laux’s mother. Her work explores sexuality, survival and healing.General NonfictionWinner: “The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America,” by Greg GrandinWinner: “The Undying: Pain, Vulnerability, Mortality, Medicine, Art, Time, Dreams, Data, Exhaustion, Cancer, and Care,” by Anne Boyer“The End of the Myth” was also a finalist in the history category. In “The Undying,” “the pink ribbon, that ubiquitous emblem of breast cancer awareness, has long been an object of controversy and derision,” wrote our reviewer, but Boyer “doesn’t just pull it loose, unfastening its dainty loop; she feeds it through a shredder and lights it on fire, incinerating its remains.”Finalist: “Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life,” by Louise AronsonIn this book, Aronson, a geriatrician, draws from her 25 years of caring for patients, as well as history, science and popular culture, to paint a humanistic picture of old age.Finalist: “Solitary: Unbroken by Four Decades in Solitary Confinement. My Story of Transformation and Hope,” by Albert Woodfox with Leslie GeorgeThis “uncommonly powerful” memoir details Woodfox’s young life of crime and his time in various prisons, including four decades in solitary confinement for a crime he did not commit. “If the ending of this book does not leave you with tears pooling down in your clavicles, you are a stronger person than I am,” wrote our reviewer. “More lasting is Woodfox’s conviction that the American justice system is in dire need of reform.”

Teachers could be advised they have the right not to attend work under health and safety legislation if they do not feel it is safe to return to school, i understands.The Government is believed to be targeting 1 June to start the return to school in England. The decision is expected to be confirmed by Boris Johnson on Sunday.Year 6 pupils are expected to be the first group of children to return to school, but some teachers and school leaders are sceptical about reopening classes on that date.Ten and 11-year-old pupils in Year 6 of primary school are expected to be the first cohort going back, with secondary school students in Years 10 and 12 to follow.School transitionIf schools are reopened without the profession being on board, then education unions will not be able to encourage teachers to stay at home because they could leave themselves open to accusations of backing illegal strikes. However, it is understood that teachers could be reminded of Section 44 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which protects an employee’s right to withdraw from a workplace if they believe it is unsafe.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: "The overriding concern is that any decision is underpinned by public health and scientific advice that the timing is right, and that there is clear guidance to schools and colleges on the measures which will need to be put in place to protect staff and pupils from the risk of infection. It will be necessary to build confidence that it is safe to return to schools, because otherwise parents will vote with their feet, and they will not send their children to school."For all these reasons, we would urge that any date is kept under review, and that if more time is needed then the date is changed accordingly."The NASUWT teaching union has said the Government needs to give “clarity about the purpose of reopening schools”, and schools need “much more detail and sufficient time to enable them to prepare”.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union - the UK’s biggest teaching union - accused the Government of a lack of transparency in developing its plans.“It would be really great if they could come clean with us about what their plans are,” she told i. Dr Bousted said mixed messages on when and how schools will reopen had been “damaging and really unhelpful”, and “as a public relations strategy it seems to me to be wholly counterproductive.”She said her union had repeatedly pressed the Government to share the latest scientific evidence about children’s role in spreading Covid-19, along with current thinking about how to mitigate the spread, to no avail.“Schools aren’t built for social distancing, nor is our education system built for not having lots of contact with kids,” she said. “There are massive questions around cleaning, around personal protective equipment, and around the science, and we haven’t had answers to those yet.”Dr Bousted said the NEU wanted schools to reopen but the union needed to know “what the risks are and what the mitigation of those risks are”.'Important milestone'Cathie Paine, the deputy chief executive of Reach2, the largest primary school chain in England, told i that starting with Year 6 pupils made sense.“It’s absolutely essential that we stem any loss of learning in this crucial year for pupils and support them as best we can in their move to secondary school," she said. "Leaving primary school is a really important milestone, and so the lovely benefit of having Year 6s back in school means that we can also properly celebrate their last weeks in primary before they take that exciting next step. But of course, all of this must only be done if we can be confident of the safety of our children and our staff.”Dan Morrow, the chief executive of the Woodland Academies Trust - which runs four primary schools in London and north Kent - told i that practising social distancing with Year 6 pupils would be “potentially easier” than younger years.However, he questioned whether they were the right pupils to prioritise for return. “Are we trying to achieve an important goodbye to primary?... The vast majority of saying goodbye to primary doesn’t really involve social distancing, it involves lots of hugs, signing shirts, the production.“The absolute glory of the end of Year 6 is somewhat smashed by the social distancing rules.”He added: “It’s possibly not about year groups, it’s about characteristics and context and so for me, it’s more important that we’re getting [back] those children who have got speech and language delays, or who are in circumstances that are more challenging around their wellbeing.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has not set a date for schools reopening.“Schools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by Government to beat this virus have been met.”“We are also working closely with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.”

President Trump bashed the World Health Organization [WHO] on Sunday, saying the group mishandled the coronavirus pandemic by giving deference to China, during his Fox News Town Hall with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, focused on reopening America during the public health crisis.Trump answered questions submitted by Fox News viewers on Twitter, Facebook and InstagramQuestion: Are you considering new tariffs to punish China? “The World Health Organization has been a disaster,” Trump said.Trump said the WHO passed along “wrong” information and was China-centric. Trump noted that the United States “foolishly” has been paying the group $450 million a year whereas China has been paying $38 million a year.“But, the [WHO] were more political than all of our leaders previously,” Trump said. “What the WHO did, they missed every single call.”Question: “Is there enough evidence that China misled the global community about this coronavirus? If so, how should the global community respond?“Don’t forget, China tried to blame the [coronavirus pandemic] on some of our soldiers and that didn’t go too far,” Trump noted, a reference to statements appearing on Chinese state media. Trump said China then tried to blame it on Europe as Italy “suffered probably more than anybody per capita.”Trump also said China made a “horrible mistake and they did not want to admit it.”
Scientists have insisted the most vulnerable must remain protected.Some have suggested the "segmentation and shielding" approach would be most beneficial for getting the nation back to normality.This includes strengthening the shielding of society's most frail — including all over-70s and giving them added protection while relaxing measures for everyone else.Research suggests this would give young healthy adults and children greater freedoms while ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected. However, it has been reported that ministers now plan to ignore this advice.Today is was reported that ministers are planning to allow healthy over-70s be released from lockdown with the rest of the UK.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute, said: "Easing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff."Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."The model would ensure certain measures would stay in place.This includes the use of the NHSX contact-tracing app, social isolation upon expressing symptoms of COVID-19, quarantine of entire households and social distancing.However, it would allow society's fittest to slowly reclaim some of their lost freedoms.In contrast, a cabinet member told The Telegraph they would be "very surprised" if there was any tightening of the lockdown for the over-70s.The minister said: "The all over-70s grouping is going to morph."There is a big difference between the 1.5million "shielded" people, known as extremely critically vulnerable, who have been sent a letter advising them to shield for 12 weeks, vulnerable people with pre-existing conditions of any age, and healthy over-70s."This needs to be made clearer - you can't just have a blanket over-70s group, that's unsustainable."This comes as anxiety levels for over-70's have doubled amid the coronavirus lockdown according to new figures.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that the elderly in the UK are no longer happier than their younger counterparts.The ONS said that the COVID-19 lockdown has had a massively negative effect on the over-70’s in the UK.Traditionally this age group is one of the happiest in the UK, with levels regularly higher than all ages below.The government body said: “Those aged 70 years and above reported being happier than those aged 16 to 69 years before the lockdown.“By the third week of lockdown, however, this gap had closed, so there was no significant difference in levels."Matt Hancock said last month older people would be "shielded for their own protection", meaning those aged 70 and over could be asked to stay at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the risk of the virus.The ONS continued: "The Government has advised the over-70s to be more stringent with social distancing measures and to ask friends, family and neighbours for support with essential supplies including food and medicine.“This could be leading to higher anxiety for this group." 
The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling car in the UK last month, as new car sales dropped 97% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that 658 Model 3s were sold in April, accounting for around 15% of all new car sales. With dealerships closed and customers adhering to the nationwide stay-at-home directive, just 4321 new cars were sold in April, down from 161,064 in the same period last year.The Model 3 led an unusual list of the 10 best-selling cars in April, with the UK's traditional biggest sellers largely absent. The list featured both electric cars such as the Model 3 and Jaguar I-Pace, and MPVs including the Ford Tourneo Custom and Peugeot Rifter. UK new car registrations fall 97% in April due to coronavirus lockdownThis is the second time Tesla’s entry-level electric saloon has appeared in the UK top 10, it having been a strong seller here since its arrival in early 2019. In February 2019, it became Europe’s best-selling electric vehicle in its first full month on sale outside the US, but it still accounts for just 0.9% sales in the UK so far this year. The model's releatively high sales can be attributed to the completion of online pre-orders made on Tesla's website before the lockdown. A number of sales are also likely to be to company fleets - which the SMMT says accounted for 70% of all sales in April. Recent changes introduced to the UK vehicle excise duty system saw EVs become exempt from benefit-in-kind tax, thus enhancing their appeal for fleet buyers. That’s backed up by sales figures for Jaguar’s electric I-Pace SUV, which was the second-highest seller in April with 367 units sold. Earlier this year, the British marque reached a deal to supply 700 I-Paces to the NHS for use by healthcare workers, with the first expected to arrive in April. The SMMT expects electric vehicles to perform relatively strongly in 2020, bucking an overall industry decline to double their market share by the end of the year with an estimated 77,300 units sold.The Vauxhall Corsa placed third in the list, with 264 units sold. In March, the supermini came in at number six with more than 20 times as many sales. Vauxhall’s larger Crossland X crossover placed fourth with 143 units sold. 
The second meteor shower in as many weeks will dazzle the eyes of stargazers around the globe, but the light show will be battling against the glow of a nearly full moon when it reaches its peak.The Eta Aquarids is an annual meteor shower in early May, and this year, it reached its climax on Monday night and the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning.“This shower happens to be one of if not the best in the Southern Hemisphere,” AccuWeather Astronomy Blogger Dave Samuhel said. “It is a moderate shower for the Northern Hemisphere.”People living south of the equator may count as many as 40 shooting stars per hour at the height of the celestial light show, the American Meteor Society (AMS) said. This includes Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America.“From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn,” the AMS added.This year, the meteor shower peaked just two nights before the final supermoon of 2020. The bright moon may make it difficult to see some of the fainter meteors, but it should not completely wash out the shower.Of course, weather and cloud cover will significantly factor into how well sky gazers in different parts of the country are able to witness the meteor shower Monday and Tuesday night.Onlookers across the southern U.S. and the interior West had the best viewing conditions on Monday night for 2020’s iteration of the Eta Aquarids.The Eta Aquarids will continue to be active on Tuesday night, providing onlookers with another opportunity to see the celestial light show.Clouds are forecast to become more widespread over the eastern and western U.S., but mainly clear conditions are expected to remain over the Four Corners and southern Plains. Northern New England and most of Florida should also have favorable viewing conditions on Tuesday night.There won't be another major meteor shower until the Delta Aquarids peak in late July.Tips for viewing the Eta AquaridsNo special equipment is needed to watch a meteor shower, although people should pack some patience when heading out to spend some time under the stars.“Give yourself a solid hour to look for meteors. Get comfortable. Lay down on a blanket, or a reclining chair,” Samuhel said.People should also avoid looking toward the moon, which will be above the horizon for most of the night. Looking at the moon can make it harder to see meteors, so try to focus in the darkest part of the sky.The best time to watch the meteor shower will be after midnight once the shower’s radiant point climbs above the horizon.The radiant point is simply the part of the sky where the meteors originate, but you do not need to look in this direction to spot meteors. However, as the radiant point climbs higher in the sky, more and more meteors will able to be seen.Shooting stars from Halley's CometMany of the meteor showers throughout the year are caused by debris left behind by comets when they visit the inner solar system. When this debris enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it burns incredibly bright for a few brief seconds.“The majority of visible meteors are caused by particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams,” the AMS said.The debris that causes the Eta Aquarids is actually dust left behind by one of the most famous comets — Halley’s Comet.Halley’s Comet only orbits the sun once every 75 years, but each year in early May, the Earth passes through some of the debris that it left behind.“The Eta Aquarids are one of two meteor showers sparked by Halley's comet. The other being the Orionids in October. “ People that miss out on the Eta Aquarids will need to wait a few months before the next opportunity to catch a meteor shower.According to the AMS, the next major meteor shower will not peak until late July.

More than four million Italians were allowed back to work on Monday, while cafes also reopened in Europe's coronavirus epicentre.It marked the end of the the continent's first and longest, keeping people from their jobs and loved ones.Fabrizia Maselli was allowed to make the short 15-minute walk from home to visit her mother for the first time since the start of March, for an emotional reunion.She is just one of many families kept separated, even those who live close by due to the severity of the lockdown imposed on the country.Protective masks are the new norm and were required on public transport and inside cafes, restaurants and gelato shops that opened for take-out service, while one metre social distancing is still a necessity.The restrictions are similar to those experienced in the UK since the beginning of lockdown in the country.Italy is getting used to the first stage of its new normal, as they can see light at the end of the tunnel.Italians were allowed to go back to work at construction sites, factories and manufacturing jobs deemed to be at lowest risk for contagion.Traffic ticked up in city centers, commuter and long-distance trains sold out and more people ventured out after restrictions on movement eased for the first time since Italy locked down March 11.“We are being careful, trying not to do too many things, but at least we are finally outside and breathing some fresh air,” said Daniele Bianchi as he strolled through Rome’s Villa Borghese park.Across the Tiber in Villa Sciarra, Valerio Pileri stood by the stroller as his 2 1/2 year-old grandson scampered in the grass.“He was going around and around again on the terrace with his bike, but it’s not the same as the villa,” Pileri said.

As millions of us continue to stay inside, it’s vital that broadband speeds are up to scratch. Working from home, video calls, streaming radio stations and songs as well as bingeing on endless boxsets on Netflix can place huge pressure internet connections and that action can bring things to a shuddering halt. But is it just what goes on inside your home that impacts your connection?Sky  has offered its customers useful advice, which explains exactly why its broadband users could find things slower than expected. The satellite firm has a dedicated webpage with advice about why things change so dramatically.Perhaps one of the biggest reasons speeds aren’t always as good as you’d hope is due to the age and quality of the physical line coming into your home. If your street only has an old copper connection, it won’t be anywhere near as fast as the latest fibre technology.Things can also be affected by how far you live away from the exchange with speeds getting much worse the further away you are from the original source.Without digging up the tarmac outside of your home on a quiet weekend, you clearly cannot change the wires that pump broadband to your router but the next tip can be controlled by you. As Sky explains, the web is a bit like a motorway, when there’s less traffic passing along it you can go faster but add more users and things will begin to slow.One of the worst offenders for web traffic are big uploads. So if you are trying to make a video call to your boss and your kids are trying to create their first 4K YouTube channel – you could be in trouble.It’s worth remembering everything you connect to your broadband hub uses bandwidth. The more you connect, the more it slows you down. And don’t forget those things running in the background, like app updates, device backups, Google Photo uploads, and all those open browser tabs – all of these could impact speeds.Shut them down if not being used. And always keep your WIFi password on - it stops anyone else using your WiFi.The latest home technology, such as Smart TVs, Sky Q, smart lighting and connected sound systems, app-controlled thermostats ... all these use your bandwidth, so you’ll need to make sure your internet speed can handle all these devices.It’s a good idea to check each of your device’s minimum requirements and consider upgrading your package if you have too many devices on your network. One final thing to try is moving your router.Things can get an instant boost by simply moving this device off the ground and making sure it’s not near any other gadgets which could affect the signal.Sky’s advice is to keep the router out in the open - not in a cabinet, on the floor or stuck behind the TV. For the best results, 30cm of space around it’s best.Another way to make sure you get the best download speeds is to get as close to your router as possible. Sitting next to this black box will give you a better connection than when you head outside to your garden shed.If things are still terrible then it’s worth keeping a daily record of your speed using services such as speedtest.net. As part of Sky’s commitment to Ofcom’s Better Broadband Speeds, Voluntary Code of Practice, you might be entitled to cancel your contract if your actual speed falls below the one they told you when you joined.

A close ally of Boris Johnson has resigned as a minister after being found to have used his position to try to intimidate a member of the public.The international trade minister, Conor Burns, was found by the standards committee to have made a series of veiled threats while attempting to intervene in his father’s dispute over a loan.The committee recommended a suspension from parliament over multiple breaches of the MPs’ code before No 10 announced his resignation. A Downing Street spokesman said Burns had resigned after the committee’s report.The commissioner for standards received a complaint from a member of the public connected to a firm with which Burns’s father was in dispute over the repayment of a loan. The complaint centred on a letter sent by Burns, which claimed his father had made extensive attempts over a period of years to reach a settlement on repayment of that loan.In the letter, written in February 2019 on House of Commons notepaper, Burns stated he was writing on his father’s behalf enclosing an earlier letter sent by his father to the company to which, he stated, no response had been received.“I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case (on which I have taken advice from the house authorities),” Burns wrote.The MP suggested the complainant, a former senior civil servant whose name was redacted from House of Commons documents, could avoid having him raise the case in the Commons by securing the payment of the loan to his father.Burns noted the complainant’s “high-profile role” outside the company “could well add to that attention”. By raising the case during parliamentary proceedings, Burns’s words would have been protected from a legal challenge by parliamentary privilege.When confronted by Kathryn Stone, the commissioner for standards, Burns said he had not sought formal advice. Stone said his behaviour “gives fuel to the belief that members are able and willing to use the privileges accorded them by their membership of the house to benefit their own personal interests”.“The content of the letter suggests the use of the principal emblem of the house was more deliberate than accidental. And, as I explained in my letter to Mr Burns of 11 June 2019, his reference to having sought advice about privilege from the house authorities was misleading,” Stone wrote.The report released by the standards committee found that he had also misused parliamentary-headed notepaper. It accused Burns of behaving “disrespectfully” during the investigation and of claiming he had not received a memo from Stone over several months.The cross-party committee recommended he should apologise in writing to the Commons and to the individual concerned – a recommendation that will need to be signed off by the Commons.“The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament’s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism.“Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests,” the report said.Burns, 47, was made a trade minister in July when Johnson became Conservative leader and was a key member of his campaign team. He was elected to represent Bournemouth West in 2010 and defended his seat in 2015, 2017 and 2019.He served as parliamentary private secretary to Johnson when he was foreign secretary but resigned from the post in July 2018.Burns expressed his regret in a tweet on Monday. “With deep regret I have decided to resign as Minister of State for International Trade. @BorisJohnson will continue to have my wholehearted support from the backbenches,” he said.In a separate development, another minister at the Department for International Trade, Greg Hands, was ordered on Monday to apologise for misusing parliamentary stationery to send a letter to thousands of constituents.In October 2019, the Chelsea and Fulham MP had told the commissioner he was willing to publicly acknowledge he had breached the rules, apologise and reimburse the £4,865 costs. But with the election looming, Hands changed his mind.The committee said: “It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Mr Hands may well have been motivated by a desire to avoid the embarrassment of having to make a public apology for breaking parliamentary rules during a general election campaign.”  
Plans to introduce post-lockdown social distancing at airports 'won't work' and will lead to queues snaking for up to half a mile to board each large plane, Heathrow's boss warned today.Heathrow's Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye has warned that there simply isn't enough space in airports to keep each passenger two metres apart.Mr Holland-Kaye instead has called on the Prime Minister to agree an 'international standard' with other world leaders which would include passenger health checks on departure.  Mandatory health checks for passengers including taking temperatures, increased levels of hygiene and compulsory facemasks are among the options floated by Mr Holland-Kaye in order to open the nation's airports as soon as possible and avoid 'massive job losses in our sector... (and) many other sectors that depend on us'.'The Prime Minister has talked about restarting the engines of the British economy. We are ready to play our part, but first we need his help to restart the engines of the British aviation fleet,' he wrote.It came as air passengers slammed airlines for lack of social distancing after they were crammed in 'like sardines' on to rescue flights back to UK It came days after Mr Holland-Kaye told the PA news agency that it is 'just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport'.He added that social distancing on planes would reduce capacities by more than 50 per cent and mean 'prices would shoot up'.Severity of the crisis facing the aviation industry was laid bare last night as British Airways announced plans to lay off a quarter of its pilots.The nation's flag carrier told staff it planned to axe 1,130 captain and co-pilot jobs and may even abandon operations at Gatwick, Britain's second biggest airport.It came as the boss of Heathrow Airport revealed it could be the case that only young, fit and healthy people will be able to fly in the immediate future, and all passengers might have to wear face masks as part of a strategy to restore confidence in mass air travel.The dramatic developments underline the severity of the catastrophe facing Britain's aviation industry.Passenger numbers have flatlined in recent weeks due to global travel restrictions and industry leaders now accept it could take several years for passenger numbers to recover to pre-pandemic levels.Earlier this week, BA boss Alex Cruz announced that up to a quarter of the airline's 42,000 staff would be laid off as the airline fights for survival.He had previously warned staff that coronavirus marks the biggest threat in the airline's history, worse than 9/11 or the SARS outbreakThe airline has informed the pilots' union Balpa that the cuts could include a quarter of the airline's plots.The letter, written on April 28, reads: 'In a short space of time the situation has significantly deteriorated.'In a separate announcement, the head of BA's Gatwick operations yesterday [THU] told staff it is possible that BA could suspend operations from the West Sussex hub, where it has had a presence since 1950.In normal times, around six million BA passengers a year fly to and from Gatwick to more than 60 destinations. The airport relies heavily on seasonal holiday traffic.Insiders say that BA is preparing to dramatically downsize as part of an extreme cost-cutting strategy. This could soon include the total suspension of the few BA flights that are continuing to run. It is also likely BA will pull operations from Terminal 3 at Heathrow. It is currently based at Terminal 5. The intervention follows mounting criticism over the Government's inaction on airport screening.Critics say the total lack of checks on passengers entering the UK makes a mockery of the lockdown and threatens the health of the nation.Ministers estimate around 15,000 people are arriving into the UK every day - including many from virus-ravaged countries such as Italy, Iran and China.There are no proper checks but passengers are handed leaflets about symptoms.Airport bosses are concerned the lack of screening measures makes our airports appear more dangerous than others, and could lead to plummeting passenger numbers when flying does resume.Last week, Mr Holland-Kaye revealed to the Mail that Heathrow has requested Public Health England (PHE) release scientific evidence proving their claims that temperature screening is 'ineffective'.PHE have long insisted that such measures are futile against a virus that has an incubation period of 14 days.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the airport screening policy is 'under review', and could change in the future.The point was reiterated in a letter to all MPs from aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst earlier this week.Passenger travelling to Britain could face mandatory quarantining to control the spread of coronavirus, the Transport Secretary has said.Grant Shapps revealed he is 'actively looking at' beefed up border controls following weeks of criticism over a lack of screening at UK airports.It came as shocking pictures emerged showing packed flights, including a BA service from Heathrow to Barcelona and a Government-organised rescue flight from Turkey to Stansted.Travellers in facemasks described being crammed 'like sardines' on Wednesday's BA flight, and said the lack of distancing measures 'makes a complete mockery of the lockdown rules'.A passenger on the flight said: 'There was no requirement to wear masks but some did choose to do so. The cabin crew are not required to wear masks but some chose to do so. You will see there is no attempt at any kind of social distancing - everyone is sitting within inches of their fellow passengers.' EasyJet is considering stripping out middle seats to enable social distancing, although industry leaders fear this could make flights unprofitable and lead to higher air fares. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, Mr Shapps said he is 'actively looking at' quarantine requirements for foreign visitors, mirroring similar schemes that have been in place for weeks in dozens of other countries.He said: 'I think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease... that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense - social distancing - that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country.'I am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing.'The uncertainty over the future of air travel is one of the main reasons why BA are warning of drastic cuts in the months to come.Bosses are planning to lay off a quarter of the airline's staff - up to 12,000 workers, including one in four pilots - and the airline may even suspend operations at Gatwick.Senior BA managers were due to be questioned on the crisis in a hearing before the Commons transport committee on Wednesday.MPs had hoped to grill Willie Walsh, the boss of BA's parent company IAG, on issues relating to redundancies and delays in issuing customer refunds.However, it emerged last night that Walsh has refused to attend and no other BA senior manager will take his place. Committee chair Huw Merriman MP accused the airline of 'seeking to avoid scrutiny'. IAG declined to comment.On the issue of crowded flights a spokesman for BA said: 'Like other forms of transport we are keeping vital links open - repatriating customers and ensuring key supplies like medicines and food are flown in.'We continue to follow all the guidance from the UK Government and global health authorities, including Public Health England and the World Health Organisation. We have taken several steps to reduce contact between customers and crew, and personal protective equipment is available to them.' Airlines UK, the trade body representing airlines,warned a 14-day quarantine requirement 'would effectively kill air travel'.Chief executive Tim Alderslade said it would 'completely shut off the UK from the rest of the world when other countries are opening up their economies'.  
NASA said Tuesday it is working with Tom Cruise to film a movie on the International Space Station, but details on the arrangements are scarce.The news that Cruise was in talks with to shoot an action-adventure film on the space station was first reported Monday by Deadline, which said the actor is working with SpaceX on the project.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted Tuesday that the agency is “excited to work Tom Cruise on a film aboard the space station. We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make NASA’s ambitious plans a reality.”Cruise, the 57-year-old star of Top Gun and the Mission: Impossible film franchise, has performed daring stunts before. NASA did not confirm Tuesday whether Cruise would himself fly to the space station as part of the film.SpaceX has not confirmed its role in the film project, but Cruise could fly to the space station on the company’s Crew Dragon spaceship. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry up to four people to and from low Earth orbit, potentially room enough for Cruise, a small film crew and a professional astronaut in command.Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, tweeted Tuesday: “Should be a lot of fun!”NASA last year said it would enable private astronauts to spend up to 30 days on the International Space Station. The paying passengers would fly to the station on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft or Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, the two human-rated spaceships developed by U.S. industry in partnership with NASA.Private companies would pay for access to the orbiting research outpost, and the commercial companies would be responsible for funding the flight’s launch and trip to the space station.Earlier this year, the space tourism company Space Adventures — which arranged the flight of Garriott and other wealthy passengers to the station on Russian spacecraft — announced an agreement with SpaceX to fly paying passengers on a Crew Dragon spacecraft without going to the space station. Instead, the Crew Dragon contracted by Space Adventures will fly on its own in Earth orbit, reaching altitudes hundreds of miles above the space station to provide passengers a more expansive view of Earth.Axiom Space said in March that it signed a contract with SpaceX to ferry a professional astronaut and three paying passengers to the International Space Station as soon as next year.Deadline reported Monday that the film project is “real” but in the “early stages” of development. No studio is attached yet to the film, Deadline reported.Cruise narrated the 2002 IMAX documentary film Space Station 3D, which was filmed by astronauts during the assembly of the International Space Station. A short science fiction film named Apogee of Fear was filmed on the space station in 2008 by Richard Garriott, who paid for his trip to orbit on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.But celebrity spaceflights and past plans for filmmaking projects in orbit have faltered before reaching the launch pad.Singer Lance Bass of NSYNC began training to fly on a Soyuz mission to the space station in 2002, but his sponsorships fell through. A Russian actor hoped to fly to the Russian space station Mir in 2000, but the project collapsed due to lack of funds. 
Everyone needs something super right now, so mother nature is serving up a dazzling display in the night sky.A meteor shower from Halley’s Comet will peak Tuesday. But, a nearly full moon will make it hard to see in the northern hemisphere.That nearly full moon will turn into a supermoon on Thursday morning.If you go outside and look up, you’ll see a supermoon, the last one of four we’ll see this year. It’s a supermoon because it’s so close to earth right now.This particular moon is called the flower moon, which makes sense considering how much is in bloom right now. The moon will actually look full for three days starting Tuesday night through Friday morning.If you miss the meteor shower on Tuesday because of the bright supermoon, stargazers might have another chance to see the shower just before dawn next Sunday.This year, the Eta Aquariid meteor shower coincides with the supermoon on May 7.Otherwise, as with the famed Halley’s Comet, there’s always next year.

Andy Dalton has signed a one-year deal worth up to $7 million with the Dallas Cowboys, including $3 million guaranteed, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Cowboys confirmed the signing on Saturday night.Dalton, 32, is a Texas native who already owns a home in the Dallas area. He played college football at Texas Christian, helping the Horned Frogs defeat the Wisconsin Badgers in the 2011 Rose Bowl. The Bengals' second-round pick in the 2011 draft, Dalton spent nine seasons in Cincinnati, helping the team clinch five playoff berths. Dalton, who lost his starting job last season to then-rookie Ryan Finley, was released by the Bengals on Thursday following the selection of Joe Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL Draft.Dalton helped lead the Bengals to two AFC North division titles and five straight playoff appearances. In the process, Dalton, who posted a 70-61-2 regular season record as Cincinnati's starting quarterback, was selected to three Pro Bowls while moving past Carson Palmer and Boomer Esiason as the franchise's second all-time leading passer. He is the franchise's all-time leader in career touchdown passes (204), fourth-quarter comebacks (20) and game-winning drives (24). Dalton was unable to lead the Bengals to victory in the postseason, however, as Cincinnati is still awaiting their first playoff victory since 1990. In Dallas, Dalton will now back up Dak Prescott, who was franchise tagged by the Cowboys earlier this offseason. The Cowboys are still trying to come to a long-term contract agreement with Prescott, who set career highs with 4,902 yards and 30 touchdowns last season. Dalton joins a Cowboys quarterback room that also includes Cooper Rush, Clayton Thorson, and rookie Ben DiNucci. According to the latest projections calculated by CBS Sports' Stephen Oh, if the Cowboys were to have a falling out with Prescott and slot Dalton in as the starter, there would naturally be a noticeable drop-off in Dallas' playoff chances. With Dalton over Prescott, the club's win projection falls from 9.3 to 8.5, win percentage goes from 58.1% to 53.1%, the chances of winning the NFC East fall 14.1%, and the odds of making the playoffs dips from 69.2% with Prescott to 52.6% with Dalton. As for Dallas' odds to win Super Bowl LV, it only drops 1% with Dalton under center over Prescott. While there are certainly some sizable differences, the price tags on both of these quarterbacks will also vary as Prescott is projected to see a contact that could pay him up to $40 million annually, which is a far cry from the $7 million Dalton can make with this stint in Dallas.  Dalton is the latest former franchise quarterback to accept a backup role with a new team. Jameis Winston, who led the NFL in passing yards and interceptions thrown last season, signed a one-year deal with the Saints shortly after the draft. Cam Newton, the 2015 league MVP, is still on the open market after being released by the Panthers back in March.

For weeks the Trump reelection effort has diligently cut, catalogued and pushed out viral videos of every verbal stumble Joe Biden makes in interviews, relentlessly pushing the idea that the presumptive Democratic nominee is mentally unfit for the presidency.“There is something missing,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said last week in a campaign broadcast. “I feel bad for him. I wish his wife would pull him out of this.”But behind the scenes, the offensive has become a point of contention among some of President Trump’s closest advisers, who have spent weeks debating without resolution the best message and strategy to accomplish the Trump campaign’s central goal of tarnishing the Biden brand as poll numbers continue to show a rocky road to reelection for the president.Several political advisers, including White House senior aide Kellyanne Conway, have warned his allies against relentlessly mocking the 77-year-old Biden’s mental acuity because the president has already lost ground with senior citizens, people familiar with the matter said.Senior Democratic and Republican strategists, in private conversations, are in full agreement about the stakes of the discussions now taking place at the White House and in campaign conference calls. If President Trump and his political machine don’t find a way to drive up Biden’s unpopularity with voters, they argue, the president will have little shot at winning a second term.“We have to introduce people to a different Joe Biden,” a Trump campaign adviser said. “One of the reasons we won in 2016 is because so many people hated Hillary Clinton. I’m not sure people hate Biden that much.”Republicans need the election to be a choice between Biden and Trump and not a referendum on the president’s performance and rhetoric in office, according to Republican and Democratic strategists. On this score, Democrats said they are — for the moment — more bullish on Biden’s prospects than they expected to be just a few months ago.ADThe debate over when and how to launch a focused and sustained attack on Biden with paid advertising has yet to be resolved inside the president’s campaign, according to multiple sources.“There are advisers telling him to wait until the convention. Other people saying go at it now,” said one Trump campaign adviser, who like others requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. “It is not decided.”Adding to the dilemma for the president’s campaign is that the coronavirus pandemic has focused the spotlight brightly on the president and his controversial handling of the outbreak while Biden maintains a relatively low profile, doing interviews and virtual campaign events from a basement office at his home in Delaware.The latest on the pandemic and the Trump administration’s responseThe pandemic has delayed a widely expected anti-Biden advertising offensive by the vastly wealthier Trump campaign, allowing Democratic super PACs to outspend Republicans in key swing states over the last month. Biden’s approval ratings are also far stronger than those of the last Democratic nominee, Clinton, at this point in 2016.“Our expectation was always that Trump would go on offense early and we’d have to scramble to defend against his attacks,” said Josh Schwerin, an adviser to Priorities USA, a super PAC supporting Biden. “The reality has been we’ve been able to run millions of dollars of thoroughly researched and tested ads, largely unanswered, and Trump’s numbers in these states have been eroding badly.”Trump decided last month to delay a decision by his campaign leadership to run ads attacking Biden’s policy toward China, after multiple advisers urged him to focus on selling his leadership as president during the pandemic first. As a result, the campaign has said it will spend more than $1 million over the next week on advertising across the country promoting Trump’s pandemic response, a move that Democrats have dismissed as a cosmetic move to please the president, who is consumed by what he watches on cable television.Parscale has repeatedly argued that getting Biden’s unfavorable numbers up is key to winning the election in November, according to people who have heard his comments.He has told other campaign advisers that positive ads do not do as much for the president's political fortunes as negative ads against Biden, and that is why he wants to focus on campaign ads that are anti-Biden, even as some advisers would prefer a different approach.“You can’t let Biden hide in the shadows,” Parscale has told surrogates, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments.Parscale has been among the most aggressive advocates in going after Biden, but his standing has become shaky at times with the president, four Trump advisers said.Trump’s team hopes to target Biden particularly over China once the pandemic wanes along with trade deals and some of the more liberal policy positions he committed to during the Democratic debates, such as health care for undocumented immigrants. The Trump campaign has several ads about China ready to go.A recent Republican National Committee poll showed 51 percent of voters in 17 swing states — such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — blame China the most for the coronavirus, according to a person briefed on the results. Some 24 percent blame Trump the most.The polling on China is so strong that the major Trump super PAC, America First Action, has launched a $10 million campaign casting Biden as “weak” on handling the U.S. rival. The group purchased the Web address BeijingBiden.com in 2019, long before the pandemic.“It is not that there is one line of attack against Joe Biden. The most damaging thing against Joe Biden is that while he has high name ID, the depth of impression of him is weak,” America First Action president Brian O. Walsh said. “He is relatively a blank slate.”The America First spots have been matched by a similar investment in the same states from the pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, which has been running ads that cast Trump as caving to pressure from China.“Since November, we’ve defined Trump in key battlegrounds — outspending him on TV and radio in our target states,” said Bradley Beychok, the group’s president.Some Trump allies and campaign surrogates are also focusing on the allegation from Tara Reade that Biden sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s — an accusation Biden denies — as well as the former vice president’s tendency to make verbal gaffes. But the latter two arguments are challenging given the president’s history of women accusing him of sexual assault, which includes Trump caught on tape bragging about grabbing women’s genitals, and his tendency to also veer off script into meandering, untruthful comments.Trump has complicated the matter further this week by repeatedly suggesting in public that Reade’s allegation may be false.“I would just say to Joe Biden, ‘Just go out and fight it,’ ” Trump said Friday during an interview with conservative podcast host Dan Bongino.A number of Trump’s top political advisers said they are frustrated that Biden is “hiding out” in his basement, making fewer gaffes and public comments than they hoped, even if they anticipated this before the pandemic.“We always thought he was going to play Biden-seek once he got the nomination, leaving it to his ads and his handlers to shape his image. This has given him an ability to do that,” Ronna McDaniel, chair of the RNC, said in an interview.Trump’s advisers have taken heart in some recent internal polls that show voters seeing the president as more energetic and more of a “not your average politician” than Biden. Some 20 percent see Trump as not an average politician, according to a recent RNC poll reviewed by The Washington Post, while 69 percent see Biden as more of a normal politician.ADSome Trump advisers said they are happy that Biden is basically being a pundit on TV instead of calling troops overseas, working with food banks or doing things that would get him more positive media coverage and draw a contrast with the president during the pandemic.Conway has been one of the adviser’s arguing for a delay in attacking Biden on China and along with others has pushed for going after him as an establishment, insider politician.“To me, it’s just sequence. You have the president, you have the secretary of state, you have many Democrats angry with China about the virus,” she said in an interview. “You set that groundwork now. And then, later, you say Biden has spent four decades being compliant and complacent. It’s about sequencing.”The Biden campaign dismissed the idea that the former vice president is vulnerable on the issue of China.“Kellyanne Conway should read the Trump campaign’s own polling, which shows Joe Biden winning in a landslide after sounding the alarm about coronavirus early, publicly warning Donald Trump not to trust the Chinese government about containment, and calling for testing on the scale we need to overcome this outbreak,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.Working from the White House while many top campaign aides are at home during the pandemic, Conway has been dispatched to help the president improve his numbers among senior citizens, which have dropped in recent public and internal polling. She helped orchestrate an event at the White House on Thursday where Trump spoke with leaders of senior citizens groups.Recent RNC polling showed that voters in the 17 swing states — a list that includes Arizona, Florida and North Carolina — see the two men as essentially equal when it comes to being “weak or confused,” 45 percent saw Biden as more weak and confused, while 44 percent saw Trump that way.Voters view Trump as more of an outsider — 69 percent to 20 percent — and better at getting things done and handling the economy. Some 46 percent say Trump is in better health, while 37 percent say Biden is in better health.But voters say Biden better understands average people and is more honest, compassionate, calm and committed to making health care more affordable by double-digit margins, the poll showed. Voters also see Biden as more intelligent and competent, the poll showed.Trump aides have been discussing attacks that range from going after Biden for not supporting the raid on Osama bin Laden to supporting taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants and supporting the Green New Deal and its champion liberal freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), according to Republican officials. Other attacks would focus on Biden’s support of the Iraq War or backing the NAFTA trade agreement, Trump advisers said.They are also looking to exploit divisions in the Democratic Party — from liberals who are skeptical of Biden’s more centrist positions to moderates and independents who are skeptical of him promising more liberal positions. Trump advisers say they hope to unearth more contentious Senate votes and want to see his papers at the University of Delaware covering his 36 years as a senator.In 2016, Trump and his campaign were successful in making Hillary Clinton unpopular, magnifying concerns that predated the campaign by focusing on her government emails, foreign entanglements, speaking fees and long career as a Washington insider.Like Clinton, Biden has spent decades in Washington as a political insider, but Trump, who withstood a massive negative advertising onslaught in 2016, is now running for reelection as the president, potentially blunting the attack.“It will be interesting to see if it works,” said Amanda Loveday, an adviser to the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country. “Because it didn’t work against Donald Trump. And I would argue it didn’t work against Hillary Clinton because the people who didn’t like her already didn’t like her.”
