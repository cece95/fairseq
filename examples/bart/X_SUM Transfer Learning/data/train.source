US President Donald Trump has predicted 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the country and a vaccine to be ready by the end of the year, contradicting experts who said a cure is likely 18 months away.Trump relaunched his election campaign on Sunday, forecasting an "incredible" future as he alternated during a two-hour Fox News broadcast between predicting a rapid recovery for the US economy and casting blame for the pandemic's spread on China, where the disease is believed to have originated.COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, has infected more than 1.1 million and killed more than 67,000 in the United States, shut wide swaths of society, including most schools and many businesses."We're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to a 100,000 people. That's a horrible thing," said Trump.As recently as Friday, he had said he hoped fewer than 100,000 Americans would die and earlier in the week had talked about 60,000 to 70,000 deaths.Trump faced few tough questions in the event, which gave him a new format to reach the public [Joshua Roberts/Reuters]About half of the states in the US have now moved towards at least partial lifting of lockdowns as the number of new cases started to drop or level off and as citizens agitate for relief from restrictions that have sent the economy into a tailspin."We can't stay closed as a country [or] we're not gonna have a country left," Trump said.Few tough questionsThe US president faced a few tough questions in the event, which gave him a new format to reach the public while he is unable to hold campaign rallies and after he faced widespread criticism for his combative daily briefings.In an assessment that clashes with those of some public health experts, Trump said he believed that there would be a vaccine for COVID-19 by the end of the year."The doctors would say, well, you shouldn't say that," Trump said. "I'll say what I think ... I think we'll have a vaccine sooner than later."Many health experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, have cautioned that a vaccine is likely a year to 18 months away.There is an "incredibly small" chance of having a highly effective vaccine or treatment for the coronavirus within the next year, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on April 22.Trump also said he wanted students to return to schools and colleges in autumn (in the months of September to December in the US), even as he acknowledged the possibility of a resurgence of the disease."We'll put out the embers, we'll put out whatever it may be. We may have to put out a fire," he said.Speaking the day before the Senate returns to Washington, DC, Trump said it was possible that federal coronavirus aid could rise to $6 trillion from the nearly $3 trillion Congress has already passed to try to ease the heavy economic toll of the crisis."There is more help coming. There has to be," he said.Meanwhile, Trump, who has been criticised for not moving faster early in the year to stop the spread of the disease, sought to blunt criticism by blaming China.He said China made a "horrible mistake" without saying precisely what this was or providing specific evidence for his assertion. Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was "a significant amount of evidence" that COVID-19 emerged from a Chinese laboratory, but did not dispute US intelligence agencies' conclusion that it was not man-made.

If Nintendo won't do it, modders will: Mario 64 has been ported to the PC with full native 4K resolution support, ultra-wide monitor support, and ultra-smooth animationsRemember when 64 bits and polygons were all the rage? Now that classic era has been reborn in high-end PCs, and skilled modders have successfully ported Mario 64 onto PC with Unreal Engine 4. This isn't emulation like the Super Mario Odyssey 64 mod, but a literal native port that uses reverse-engineered decompiled code from the N64 game. The project was built in Unreal Engine 4 with DirectX 12 support, which allows for high resolutions like 3840 x 2160, support for 21:9 aspect ratios, and compatibility with other graphics overhaul mods and shaders. The results are smooth animations, high-def textures and graphics (even if they're polygonal), and a generally all-around improved experience. If Nintendo officially released Mario 64 on PC, it'd look and play something like this. The Mario 64 PC port will be a huge template for modders everywhere. It's basically the entry point to crazy off-the-wall creations, complete with native DX12 support. This will make it far easier for creators to make and import assets and content into the pipelines for new unique mods. Nintendo probably isn't happy about this one bit and we could see some actions taken by the billion-dollar console titan.

A man who returned to the UK to avoid coronavirus has said he "should never have left China" as things return to normal in Wuhan.Matt Raw, from Cheshire, said he went "out of the pot, into the fire" when he was released from two-week quarantine after returning at the end of January.He said his family came back to escape the "killer virus running loose".He believes China has done "everything right" acting more quickly than the UK to restrict the spread of the disease.Mr Raw, who lives in Wuhan with his wife, Ying, 38, and his 75-year-old mother, Hazel, said when the family left China, coronavirus was not in England.They were among 83 British passengers flown out of Wuhan following the outbreak and had to stay in quarantine in Wirral in an accommodation block for NHS staff.Mr Raw said: "I think the first case was while we were in quarantine in Arrowe Park, and I thought 'They have seen what happened in China, they will jump on this straight away'."They did nothing."'Control of situation'Mr Raw said for friends and family in Wuhan things were starting to get back to normal.He said: "They're out of lockdown, it looks like they've got control of the situation."They're still being sensible, taking precautions and not going out unnecessarily."Mr Raw said he will not return to China until there is a vaccine for Covid-19 making it safe for his mother, who has dementia, to travel.He praised his neighbours where he is now living in Knutsford who have been supporting each other, making it all "very, very bearable indeed".He said: "I would rather be in quarantine over here than in China, but I think, very definitely, that coming back here was a mistake."We've made our bed so we just have to put on a happy face and lie in it now."

The Bundesliga has been given the green light to resume in the coming weeks by chancellor Angela Merkel – with May 15 the earliest possible day for a restart. A leaked document on Wednesday said German football's return would be delayed with suggestions that the first fixtures could only be held after a two-week quarantine of all teams.  But initial demands for that extended spell have been removed from the document and the German government has now granted approval for a return of the league in the second half of May after a series of meetings, with Merkel commenting: 'We can safely state the first phase of the pandemic is behind us.'The government has told the Bundesliga, according to Bild, that they can pick a date in that timeframe for a return. The earliest option available would see the first action played on May 15. After the decision in Wednesday's meeting of German states and chancellor Merkel, the league now has to decide whether to start on May 15 or 22. All games will have to take place behind closed doors – or, as they are known in Germany, as 'ghost games'. Merkel commented: 'We have talked about sports and recreation and the Bundesliga, which will be able to resume operation soon.'A further meeting of the league and the clubs will now be held on Thursday to decide when the first match will take place. Chancellor Merkel held a meeting with the 16 heads of state on Wednesday morning at 10am to discuss Germany's plans for easing the lockdown – with some measures having been lifted on Monday. And one of the topics was the return of football – with approval given to a plan to allow a resumption from May 15.While the majority of states were keen on that date for a resumption, Rhineland-Palatinate and Bremen suggested it should take place later.There are concerns at Werder Bremen that their players will not be fit enough to restart as they have not been allowed to train due to restrictions in their state – and they believe they need 14 days of preparation.They are calling for the league to begin again later than the mooted May 15 date. The Bundesliga had initially hoped to resume on May 9, although that was pushed back. There were concerns that a series of incidents over the last few days could have caused issues. Salomon Kalou was suspended by Hertha Berlin after filming himself violating hygiene protocols – shaking hands with team-mates, for example.The first two rounds of tests held earlier this week revealed there had been 10 positive coronavirus cases.Meanwhile, Bundesliga 2 side Aue sent their whole team into isolation on Tuesday after a staff member tested positive.Health minister Jens Spahn said on Wednesday that there had to be strict punishment for violations of the coronavirus protocols: 'We have seen in the past few days that some players have to be more aware that something is at stake. 'That is why a clear crackdown of the German Football League and the individual teams is very, very important.'But he did hint at a resumption, adding: 'My impression is, of course, that many millions of fans in Germany also ask when it can start again'.There were 61 new deaths in Germany from coronavirus on Monday, as a strict testing regime has limited the spread of the virus.With the Bundesliga to be the first major league back if a May 15 resumption is confirmed – and the likes of the Premier League watching on – Bayern Munich star Manuel Neuer has urged the division's players to act responsibly.'I am speaking consciously of the football family and football matches, because the fact that advice will be given on the restart of the federal leagues and, if possible, a decision is likely to have consequences for all of football, right down to the many amateur clubs and the youngest generations - and beyond also for many other sports,' Neuer wrote for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.'Even from other European countries, and indeed all over the world, people will be looking at us. This is an enormous responsibility for us, which we must be aware of with every fibre. We must be aware that it is also important to us now.' Elsewhere in Europe, LaLiga's players will start returning to training this week while the Premier League's 'Project Restart' will be discussed further on Monday.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control confirmed 141 new cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 6,626.In addition to the new cases, state health officials said eight more people have died after testing positive for COVID-19, including two individuals from Richland County. Other deaths were reported in Berkeley, Clarendon, Greenville, Horry, Lexington and Spartanburg counties. All eight deaths were elderly patients, according to state health officials.The death toll in South Carolina has now reached 275.Of the 141 new cases, 17 of them are from Richland County. Richland continues to lead the state in positive coronavirus tests with 964.There were nine positive tests in Lexington County, bringing the number there to 420. Kershaw County had two positive tests reported Sunday. Fairfield County had 26 positive tests and had just 42 before Sunday’s results.As of Sunday, DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory has conducted 16,860 tests for COVID-19. Of these tests, 2,280 were positive and 14,580 were negative. A total of 64,188 total tests by both DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory and private labs have been conducted in the state.According to projections from DHEC, officials expect to see 1,205 cases this week, from May 3-9.State epidemiologist Linda Bell said Friday that the SC’s epidemic curve of new cases per day appears to be “beginning to level,” but she also said it is critical that people continue to follow social distancing and health guidelines from DHEC and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Beginning Monday, SC Gov. Henry McMaster announced his “home or work” order would be become voluntary and restaurants would be able to host diners in outdoor seating. McMaster also lifted his executive order requiring visitors from coronavirus “hot spots” to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering the state as he tries to restart the state’s economy, which has been hammered by the pandemic.State parks and most beaches also have been reopened over the past week in South Carolina. As of Sunday afternoon, 3,485,948 people worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 246,125 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States leads the world with 1,148,004 people who have been diagnosed with the novel virus. In the U.S., 67,200 deaths have been reported, including 18,572 in New York City.Symptoms of coronavirus can include a fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, according to the Centers for Diease Control and Prevention. Among the emergency warning signs of COVID-19 is trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest and blueish lips or face.DHEC is encouraging people to practice social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus. Social distancing means refraining from unnecessary interactions with sick people and staying away from large groups of people; it also calls for remaining at home unless it is absolutely necessary to go out.The best way to prevent infection is to frequently wash hands for 20 seconds; avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth; avoid contact with sick people and clean frequently touched objects with a cleaning spray or wipe, according to the CDC. DHEC also recommends covering your cough, staying home when sick, and disposing tissues and other items that you’ve sneezed or coughed into.Free online screenings also can be accessed by all South Carolina residents by going to scdhec.gov/COVID19.Prisma Health is also offering free access to medical professionals for those who think they may have coronavirus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan could ease some of the current coronavirus-related curbs on economic activity by allowing places such as parks and museums to reopen, provided proper preventive measures were in place, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Sunday.The remarks come a day before the government is set to announce the extension of its state of emergency after struggling to suppress the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected 15,589 people and killed 530 in the country.“As long as the proper preventive measures are in place, it could be possible to ease some of the current restrictions on economic activities,” Nishimura said at a news conference held on Sunday morning.Places like parks, museums, art galleries, and libraries could reopen even in the 13 prefectures where the coronavirus has spread rapidly, if they take steps to disinfect their premises and ensure visitors maintain their distance, he added.Further details on how restrictions might be eased would be discussed at an expert’s meeting on Monday, Nishimura said.The government-issued state of emergency in Japan is set to expire on Wednesday, the last day of a week-long national holiday. The government is preparing to extend the state of emergency for another month.Under the state of emergency, the government has asked people to stay at home, avoid unnecessary outings, and refrain from going to crowded areas.

We test how the $399 iPhone SE and its single rear camera compares to the $699 iPhone 11 and its dual rear cameras. It's not as straightforward as it seems. Despite widespread enthusiasm for Apple's $399 price tag for its new iPhone SE, there was a lot of speculation about the camera hardware and how it might compare to the more expensive iPhone 11. Its rear camera has the same specs as those of the iPhone 8 from 2017, but some theorized that it might have the sensor from 2018's iPhone XR.Read more: iPhone SE 2020 is proof that Apple won't actually bring back the tiny phoneIt took an iFixIt teardown of the new iPhone to show that the SE was actually packing the same lens and sensor as the iPhone 8. That means all the improvements to image quality as well as the addition of features like Portrait Mode, come purely from the A13 Bionic chip. This processor is the same one found in the $699 iPhone 11.Since both phones have the same processor, naturally I wanted to compare photos and videos. To date, the iPhone 11 phones have not only the best cameras on any iPhone, but one of the best all-around camera systems on any phone.The iPhone SE has a lot to live up to, but as you will see, it can go toe-to-toe with its pricier Apple siblings. This comparison shows that when it comes to photography and recording videos, the real consideration isn't the number of megapixels or number of cameras. Instead, it's all about the processor.iPhone SE vs. 11: SmartHDR makes photos look fantasticThe combination of the A13 Bionic chip and iOS 13 absolutely raises the iPhone 8's camera hardware to the next level on the SE. The iPhone SE's rear camera has a 28mm f1.8 lens, while the iPhone 11 has two rear cameras: a main one with a 26mm f1.8 lens and an ultrawide-angle camera with a 13mm f2.4 lens. Since the 11 has an ultrawide-angle camera and the SE doesn't, there isn't much to compare. But here are a couple of my favorite photos that I took with the ultrawide-camera anywayWhen I focused on the main cameras of each, I noticed that in good light, photos were nearly indistinguishable. Look at the pictures of a tree I took in my backyard below and you won't be able to tell much of a difference. The iPhone SE photo is framed ever-so-slightly tighter than the iPhone 11. But in every other way (even when I zoomed into each to 100% on a large monitor) I couldn't see any other differences.Take a look at the photos I took of some wood slats. Again, aside from framing, it's hard to see any difference. When I zoomed in, details from each photo were good. Both had small amounts of image noise in the shadows of the slats.The reason photos in good light look so similar is that whether you're on an iPhone 11, 11 Pro or the new SE, the latest version of SmartHDR is used to process and optimize details and textures. It also pushes the dynamic range as much as possible without the image falling apart.Here is where we start to see some differences between the two phones. The photo below of a tree showcases the strength of SmartHDR processing. This scene has lighting extremes with dark shadows under the tree and bright highlights in the clouds. Look closely at the iPhone 11 photo and you can see the shadows have more detail and aren't as dark as the iPhone SE. In the sky through the branches, you see that both photos have blown out highlights, but the iPhone 11 has less. Though this is a minor detail, it's evidence that the main camera on the iPhone 11 handles a wider dynamic range better than the iPhone SE.Portrait mode: 1 camera vs. 2Both phones have portrait mode and produce excellent results. The 11 can take portrait mode photos of people and pets while the iPhone SE can only do people, which is a big drawback if your an animal lover. With the portrait mode photos below, you'll see that they look very similar. The iPhone 11's portrait captures more details. For example, look at the hair on John's forehead. Also, the falloff over the shoulders from in-focus to out-of-focus areas appears more natural from the iPhone 11 and that might be due to the fact that it uses both rear lenses to create the effect.Deep fusion processing for medium to low-lightWhen we get into medium- and low-light environments, the differences between the two phones are even starker. That's because the iPhone 11 has Deep Fusion processing which improves image quality, details and minimizes image noise. The iPhone SE lacks Deep Fusion.The photos below are of my bike trainer taken indoors in medium lighting. Besides the tighter framing in the iPhone SE photo, there is a notable difference in terms of image quality. The photo from the 11 have a pinch more detail, like around the wall outlet.In addition, the bottom right corner of the iPhone SE's photo suffers from image noise in the shadows. I'd say that for indoor and medium light photos, the 11 has the edge because its use of Deep Fusion processing. Night mode vs. no night modeNight mode, which is on the iPhone 11 but not the SE, is another sizable difference between the two phones. Night mode uses adaptive bracketing, taking a series of images with various shutter speeds. It combines them into a single photo that is brighter, has less image noise and improved details. Like the iPhone 11's ultrawide-angle camera, your own preferences will dictate whether having night mode is a deal-breaker. But let's see what it can do.Below are photos of a tree in my backyard taken when it was extremely dark. The iPhone 11 night mode looks better in every way.But that was a pretty extreme way to test the phones. Below is a slightly brighter low-light scene of a book, an eye drop bottle and my computer. It was dim enough to trigger night mode on the iPhone 11.As you can see if you look closely at the bottle of eye drops, the iPhone 11's photo is sharper, has better details and color accuracy. Finally, compare the author names on the spine of the book. The text looks softer in the SE photo and the book's spine is slightly a different color.Rear camera video is nearly identicalLike photos in good light, it's also difficult to discern video recording between the main rear cameras on both phones. Both phones can shoot up to 4K, 60 fps and have extended dynamic range (aka: "HDR" but for video). However, the 11 offers extended dynamic range up to 4K 60fps, whereas the iPhone SE can only support it up to 4K 30fps.Take a look at the video below which contains footage filmed from both the iPhone 11 and SE.Now playing: iPhone SE (2020) vs. iPhone 11: We compare cameras to...10:50As you can see from 4K, 60fps the footage, both videos look similar. But if you look closer, the speaker on the shelf behind me looks more contrasted in the iPhone 11 video. The lamp over my shoulder in the iPhone 11 video also isn't blown out, whereas in the iPhone SE video it is. That's due to the iPhone 11's extended dynamic range at 4K 60fps.To see more videos filmed with the iPhone SE, watch the video below.Front-facing camera: More detailed selfies and 'slowfie' videoVideos taken with the front-facing cameras, however, show a larger difference in quality. The iPhone 11 has a wider front-facing camera, and it's capable of 4K and slow-mo videos. The iPhone SE can only shoot 1,080p video and can't shoot "slofies." Both can take portrait photos, but the iPhone 11 captures much more detail (in my hair and skin, for example). Some people might not miss seeing all those details in their skin.In terms of video from the front-facing cameras, you can really see the difference in resolution and hear it in the audio. Video from the iPhone 11 sounds better and has more clarity than from the iPhone SE. Again, check out the video that accompanies this article to watch video shot with the front-facing cameras.After doing this camera comparison, it's obvious that the iPhone 11 has a better and more versatile camera system. But in many situations, the iPhone SE was able to capture images that are as comparable and brilliant, despite being hundreds of dollars cheaper than the iPhone 11.

Arizona is taking steps to gradually reopen, but many people may be nervous about venturing out and doing too much too quickly. Stepping outside your house to view the so-called Super Flower Moon this week, however, is a comfortable and a safe way to end the day. The best night for seeing the Super Flower Moon is Wednesday, May 6. But a nearly full moon on Thursday evening will make for great viewing that evening as well. The best time to view the supermoon is while it rises in the sky because the contrast against buildings and trees makes the moon appear even larger. On Wednesday night, the moonrise is at 6:40 p.m. in the Phoenix area. On Thursday, the moonrise is at 7:52 p.m. If you live outside the Phoenix area, enter your city's name into this website to find moonrise times for your area."There’s a lot of neat stuff to look at in the sky, but the moon is right up there as one of my favorites because you can see so much without any equipment," said Kevin Schindler, a historian at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.Moon activities for the familySchindler recommends three activities that can make moon gazing more fun and interactive:See who can spot the moon first. Go outside a few minutes before the moon rises and try to guess exactly where the moon will appear over the horizon. Will it appear over this fence post? Or that tree? Observe how the color changes. As it rises, the moon takes on a pink-orange glow, which is due to the Earth's atmosphere. A couple hours later, the moon appears gray and white when it's high in the sky. Watch a special program on the moon live from Arizona. Lowell Observatory will host an hour-long show on the internet, beginning at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday. The livestream will feature pictures and maps, and a discussion of the moon's geography and formation. What is a supermoon?Supermoons happen a few times a year when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit. The name comes from appearing about 14% larger and 30% brighter than a typical full moon. The May supermoon is known as the "flower moon," because flowers typically cover the ground in many parts of the country. When is the next supermoon?If you miss the May supermoon, you will have to wait almost a year for the next one. The next supermoon won't make an appearance until April 27, 2021.    
Germany’s constitutional court has threatened to block fresh purchases of German bonds through the European Central Bank’s flagship stimulus programme, potentially weakening the bloc’s monetary policy response to the coronavirus crisis. The court on Tuesday ordered the German government and parliament to ensure the ECB carried out a “proportionality assessment” of its vast purchases of government debt to ensure their “economic and fiscal policy effects” did not outweigh its policy objectives, and threatened to block new bond-buying unless the ECB did so within three months. In recent weeks the central bank has vastly expanded its quantitative easing programme of bond-buying to mitigate the economic consequences of coronavirus. It has bought more than €2.2tn of public sector debt since launching quantitative easing in 2014 in an attempt to halt a slide in inflation. The bond-buying programme has long been controversial in Germany, where critics argue the central bank has exceeded its mandate by illegally financing governments and exposing taxpayers to potential losses. Ruling in a long-running case about the legality of the bond-buying, the court in Karlsruhe said the German government and parliament had “a duty to take active steps against” QE “in its current form”. The complainants — a group of about 1,750 people, led by German economists and law professors — first brought their case in 2015. They argued the ECB was straying into monetary financing of governments, which is illegal under the EU treaty. The case was referred to the European Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of the ECB in 2018, but it went back to the German constitutional court, which on Tuesday rebuffed part of the ECJ’s earlier ruling, calling it “untenable from a methodological perspective”. By setting aside the ECJ’s 2018 judgment, the Karlsruhe court raised serious questions about the even application of EU law across the bloc. German courts have over decades of jurisprudence qualified the supremacy of EU law; other national courts have also raised objections. “What was different with Germany was that it always made clear the [constitutional] court was prepared to step in and do something about it,” said Panos Koutrakos, professor of European law at London’s City University. “This is the first case where a German court says the European court has no jurisdiction.” The court laid out a long list of reasons why the ECB may have exceeded its mandate, but said it could not decide if the ECB had broken EU law without more information on how the central bank balanced the economic and fiscal impact of its actions against its monetary policy aims. “Unless the ECB provides documentation demonstrating that such balancing took place, and in what form, it is not possible to carry out an effective judicial review as to whether the ECB stayed within its mandate,” it said.The decision may open the door to legal challenges against the ECB’s new €750bn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). The court did not rule on PEPP but it said the earlier bond purchases were only acceptable because of a number of limits that had subsequently been eased under the new programme. The plaintiffs are expected to consider whether to bring a fresh case. “This is the big risk,” Vítor Constâncio, former vice-president of the ECB, said on Twitter, saying the court had made a “ridiculous distinction between monetary policy and economic policy”. “New court cases will come immediately in Germany against PEPP,” he warned. Richard McGuire, strategist at Rabobank, said: “This is another barrier to solidarity during the Covid crisis.” He added: “We knew there was a political hurdle to sharing the costs between eurozone members — now there’s a legal one too.”Clemens Fuest, head of the Ifo economic institute in Munich, said the German court’s dismissal of the earlier ECJ ruling “reads like a declaration of war”. The euro fell 0.7 per cent against the dollar — its lowest level in a week — and the spread between 10-year Italian and German borrowing costs — a key measure of country risk in the eurozone — widened by 0.2 percentage points to 2.5 per cent.Most observers had expected the court in Karlsruhe to grudgingly accept that the ECB’s purchases of government debt were legal, and the court said that it “did not find a violation of the prohibition of monetary financing of member state budgets”. It added: “The decision published today does not concern any financial assistance measures taken by the European Union or the ECB in the context of the current coronavirus crisis.” The ECB governing council met to discuss the ruling on Tuesday evening, and said afterwards it “remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to ensure that inflation rises to levels consistent with its medium-term aim and that the monetary policy action taken in pursuit of the objective of maintaining price stability is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions of the euro area”. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, said the court ruling “highlights important features” of the ECB's sovereign bond-buying — a reference to its self-imposed limits — that he said “ensure a sufficient safety margin to monetary financing of governments”.  Mr Weidmann, who has been one of the leading critics of the ECB’s QE programme on its governing council, said: “I have indicated the importance of this margin in the past.” But he added he would “support efforts” by the ECB to explain the “proportionality of the programme”. Eric Mamer, spokesman for European Commission, said: “Notwithstanding the analysis of the detail of the German constitutional court’s decision today, we reaffirm the primacy of EU law and the fact that the rulings of the European Court of Justice are binding on all national courts.” Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, said: “It appears that we must further deepen and intensify European co-operation, and today’s verdict strengthens us in our efforts to do this, because it concedes to the ECB the fundamental right to carry out such bond-buying programmes.”

At only 18 years old, “Never Have I Ever” star Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is soon to become a household name, but the Canadian teen isn’t letting any of the early success of the show go to her head.“I think I’ll always just be a girl from Mississauga,” Ramakrishnan said on the Variety After Show, presented by National Geographic, when asked if she feels like a ‘superstar’ after the show shot to No. 1 on Netflix. “No matter what, I think that’ll always be my roots.”Ramakrishnan is currently quarantining at home with her family in Canada instead of walking the red carpet in New York or Los Angeles to celebrate the coming-of-age comedy from co-creators Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher. But the young star is still relishing in the excitement around the new show, which centers around Ramakrishnan’s character Devi Vishwakumar, an Indian American teen growing up in Southern California. Devi is a nerdy, hot-headed overachiever who desperately wants to be cool. And in addition to the ultra-relatable high school drama about fitting in, searching for love and trying to figure out who you are, Devi is also dealing with the sudden death of her father.“It’s awesome because I’m seeing so many people saying, ‘Oh my God, I can relate to this so much.’ Whether it’s something as simple as one of the arm hair jokes — because let’s be real, even though I’m 100% confident with my arm hair, there are days where I go up to my father and I say, ‘Why did you do this to me? Why can’t you give me anything else?’” Ramakrishnan says. “Or somebody saying, ‘Thank you, this made me really realize I have some unpacking to do with the loss of a family member’…That’s all I wanted from this show. Emmys for the cast, Emmys for the direction, a Nobel Peace Prize — I’m not opposed — but, in all seriousness, this is all I wanted from the show.”It’s been a whirlwind since Ramakrishnan’s first audition (recorded with her best friend at her local community center) and beating out 15,000 other actors on her way to becoming the breakout star in Kaling and Fisher’s show: “This is my first job ever. I never had a job before this. Mindy is my first boss.”“Honestly, I don’t think on set I ever felt like the star because my drama teacher always taught me if you’re a star [or] if you’re the lead of the show, that means s—. You do not matter that much. You are just the same as everyone else,” she recalls. “That was my mindset coming to set, I didn’t think I was anything crazy special. One thing I won’t forget is just having everybody be so kind to teach me everything that I asked. I asked so many questions. I wanted to learn everything — between hair and makeup to lighting and sound. My fellow actors, I love them so much because they’re the ones that gave me the confidence to do the performance I did. I couldn’t have done that just purely out of high school. A part of that process was my cast members being such great homies to me and supporting me.”Since “Never Have I Ever” debuted on April 27, Ramakrishnan has been inundated with messages from fans who have fallen in love with the series and its diverse representation, especially given the fact that her character leads the series as a South Asian young woman.“For a lot of people of color and the South Asian community — I can speak for myself here when I say that we’re so used to being sidekicks, we’re so used to being comedic relief,” she explains. “And sure, there’s nothing wrong with being a sidekick or being funny or the comedic relief … but it isn’t okay when it’s offensive and when that’s all you get. Suddenly, all you’re doing is you’re seeing yourself as a sidekick, as not as important. And when you do relate to a character, they’re usually Caucasian and then you realize you’re living your life in the shadows as a person of color and you’re only able to see yourself through white characters, which is not totally okay either.”The show also promotes cultural sensitivity, which is especially important to the young Tamil Canadian actor. “That active effort for Devi’s name ‘Vishwakumar,’ to get that right, it’s important because that’s her name. You deserve to be called the way you want to be called, no matter what.”“Obviously Tamil names are super long. My entire full name — Maitreyi Ramakrishnan — I have 20 letters, but I do have my friends at school that just call me Ramakrishnan and they pronounce it correctly. I think names are so important,” she explains. “I think one of the greatest disrespects you can do to a person is not put the effort into somebody’s name. Personally for me, I used to anglicize my name … in high school. And then when I landed in L.A., they were like, ‘How do you say your name? Sorry, I don’t want to mix it up.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this is my chance to reclaim my name’ because I love my name. Why would I change it?”As for the status of a second season of the breakout hit, Ramakrishnan says she doesn’t know anything just yet, but she has dreams for Devi’s future.“Three main things — understanding that she needs to be more appreciative of her family and her friends because her friends do a lot for her. Her friends really are her day ones. And also understanding where her mother’s coming from. That is something that we’ll be able to have a lot of audiences relate to, understanding where our parents are coming from even though they might not go about doing certain things the best way possible,” she says.“Then also the idea of approaching that grief — confronting it, having that battle, even though it’s something uncomfortable to think about, [but] actually just running toward it and facing it, dealing with it head on,” she continues. “And then number three, of course, embracing her culture because that is so important in a world where identity is everything. It’s how you portray yourself. It’s how you show yourself to the world and how everybody will view you, but also how you accept yourself. And I think if Devi does those magic three, she might be a little bit more at peace with herself.”“Never Have I Ever” is streaming on Netflix. 
UK chart data is now in for the week ending 2nd May, revealing that Animal Crossing: New Horizons has once again slipped down to second place.The game has been toing and froing with FIFA 20 over the last few weeks, with both titles fiercely contesting for first place on a regular basis.

Scientists have discovered an antibody which prevents the coronavirus from infecting human cells in "groundbreaking research" which could lead to the development of new treatments.Building on research into the SARS coronavirus, scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, as well as the Erasmus Medical Centre and the company Harbour BioMed (HBM), have identified a potential method of neutralising COVID-19.They discovered that an antibody which prevents the SARS virus from infecting human cells could also block the novel coronavirus from infecting human cells too, according a peer reviewed study published on Monday in the journal Nature Communications.Testing their collection of antibodies on cultured human cells, researchers discovered one which binds to a specific part which is present in both SARS and the virus causing COVID-19.The discovery could offer an initial step towards developing a fully-human antibody to treat or prevent the disease, which has infected more then 3.5 million people worldwide, and led to more than 247,000 deaths.The neutralising antibody "has potential to alter the course of infection in the infected host, support virus clearance or protect an uninfected individual that is exposed to the virus," said Dr Berend-Jan Bosch, co-lead author on the study.Dr Frank Grosveld, the study's other co-lead author, said the discovery provided "a strong foundation for additional research to characterise this antibody and begin development as a potential COVID-19 treatment"."The antibody used in this work is 'fully human', allowing development to proceed more rapidly and reducing the potential for immune-related side effects," he added.The fully-human antibody is different from conventional therapeutic antibodies, which are often first developed in other species before being "humanised" so they can be transmitted to people.It was developed using Harbour BioMed's H2L2 transgenic mouse technology - effectively a mouse which has been genetically engineered to contain human genes, enabling researchers to develop "human" antibodies without testing them on living people."This is groundbreaking research," said Dr Jingsong Wang, the chief executive of HBM.

An emergency proclamation issued Thursday in Stillwater, Oklahoma, requiring the use of face masks in stores and restaurants was amended Friday after threats of violence."In the short time beginning on May 1, 2020, that face coverings have been required for entry into stores/restaurants, store employees have been threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse," Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement."In addition, there has been one threat of violence using a firearm. This has occurred in three short hours and in the face of clear medical evidence that face coverings helps contain the spread of Covid-19."Due to the threats of violence the city has decided to amend their emergency order but still want people to wear face masks whenever possible, the statement said. The proclamation issued Thursday required, among other things, businesses to require patrons to cover their faces to combat the spread of coronavirus.But on Friday, Mayor Will Joyce softened the rule to encourage, not require, face coverings, after several reports emerged of employees being verbally abused and being threatened with physical violence while trying to enforce the order -- all in just three hours of the rule going into effect."Many of those with objections cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional, and under their theory, one cannot be forced to wear a mask. No law or court supports this view," said City Manager Norman McNickle in a statement. "It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk."McNickle went on to explain the importance of face coverings in preventing the spread of coronavirus. The masks have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oklahoma State Department of Health."It is unfortunate and distressing that those who refuse and threaten violence are so self-absorbed as to not follow what is a simple show of respect and kindness to others," he said.Still, the city is changing the rule, as officials "cannot, in clear conscience, put our local business community in harm's way, nor can the police be everywhere," McNickle said.Since April 3, the CDC has recommended that Americans should wear "cloth coverings" in public places.The updated guidance was in light of new evidence that many people were spreading the virus asymptomatically -- meaning that even people not exhibiting symptoms were spreading it by coughing, sneezing or even simply talking in close proximity."The idea about the face mask is to prevent the virus from coming out of somebody's mouth and nose, mostly out of their mouth," said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor in the infectious disease section at Yale School of Medicine, to CNN in April. "They prevent somebody, when they talk or sometimes when they sneeze or cough, from expelling virus and leading to infection in other people."Masks, however, are not a substitute for social distancing, which is still required to slow the spread of the virus.
World leaders, with the notable exception of Donald Trump, stumped up nearly €7.4bn (£6.5bn) to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies at a virtual event convened by the EU, pledging the money will also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries on time and equitably.But in a sign of the fractured state of global health diplomacy, the event was not addressed by India, Russia or the US. After a weekend of persuasion, China was represented by its ambassador to the EU.A separate Covid-19 summit was staged earlier in the day and addressed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders including the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani.The EU-convened virtual summit was addressed in person by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Norway, Israel, South Africa and the EU, and took the form of a pledging marathon.But the US state department released a statement welcoming what it described as “the pledging conference in Europe”, even though the fundraising summit had always been envisaged as a global, rather than strictly European effort.The US also highlighted its “vaccine partnership to prioritise drug candidates and streamline clinical trials”. Trump has suggested a vaccine will be ready by the end of the year but many scientists are sceptical that even with global cooperation such a timetable can be met.The money is largely designed to speed up the process by raising guaranteed funds to coordinate research and incentivise pharmaceutical companies to distribute any vaccines and therapies to poorer countries, something that did not happen in the 2009 swine flu outbreak.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said any distributed vaccine “won’t belong to anybody”.“Those who invent it of course will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we chose,” he said.EU officials said pharmaceutical companies who will receive the funding will not be requested to forgo their intellectual property rights on the new vaccine and treatments, but they should commit to make them available worldwide at affordable prices. A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine.Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as “a man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month”. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that “defies the usual ways of operating”.He said: “We’ll need a truly global effort – because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It’s humanity against the virus.”Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China.Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said “we support the leadership of the World Health Organization”, adding that without the UN body “an effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible”.She said that “multilateral cooperation is more important than ever” and the meeting was the start of a global movement “never seen before”.At the parallel “non-aligned movement” summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as “a strategic blunder”.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally.The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the €7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around €500m each. Turkey’s contribution will be announced later in the month.The precise value of individual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed “fantastic momentum” and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus.From the €7.5bn initially sought, €4bn is for the development of a vaccine, €2bn for treatments and €1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission.The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible.The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing.Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: “I would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit … both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.”He added: “My guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.”David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: “We have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries.“The factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?”

A ban on hot desking and employee "health passports" are amongst the measures being considered by the Government to get Britain back to work.Draft Whitehall documents propose closing office lifts and canteens and putting tape on the floor to mark where people should stand.Extra cleaning should be introduced in office spaces and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining a distance of two metres between workers is not possible.Customer-facing employees could be guarded by plastic screens, while continued home working and staggered shifts should also be encouraged, the guidance says.The proposals by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) are among a list of guidelines in seven documents drawn up after consultation with executives, trade bodies and unions.The Financial Times reported that firms will also be told to lay on more parking spaces so that staff do not have to rely on lifts from colleagues.Millions of companies will have to draw up a Covid-19 "risk assessment" before allowing staff to return to work, the documents suggest.The guidance also says social distancing will have to be maintained, whether on the shop floor, in shopping queues, or in communal spaces.A Government spokesman said: "The Business Secretary continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence to return to work."But business leaders said clarity is needed on issues such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and whether firms can be held liable even if they fulfil their obligations to protect employees from coronavirus.Director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall said the issue is one of the "key questions we've asked".He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "They (bosses) will want to know that they're not going to be held liable for horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they've done everything in their power to keep their people safe.Mr Marshall also said there is a need for "clear guidance" on PPE."No business wants to be competing with the health services or with the care sector, for example, for PPE," he told Today.A UK-wide procurement strategy will be "hugely important" in order to source and manufacture the necessary PPE, he added.Here, are what the nation's workplaces might look like once restrictions are lifted.OfficesSince the lockdown conditions were first imposed on March 23, most of the nation's office workers have become accustomed to working from home.However, companies that are eager for workers to return to the office will need to make a number of changes in order to ensure the health and safety of staff is not compromised.According to the BBC, staggered shift times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for a return to work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan.Meanwhile, the Guardian says ministers are holding talks with technology firms over the creation of "health passports" which use "coronavirus testing and facial recognition" to prove which workers have had Covid-19.RetailLast month, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) published guidance for measures that retail stores could introduce to help with the transition once restrictions are lifted.The recommended measures include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.BRC chief Helen Dickinson said the guidance measures would serve to ensure the safety and well-being of both customers and staff."Since the lockdown, many retailers have proved how shops can be run safely and effectively in line with the Government's social distancing advice," she said."Continued close collaboration with Government, including public support for the steps retailers are taking and adequate notice to get supply chains up and running, will mean that retail businesses can start trading again slowly and safely, and customers can feel confident that they are safe to return to shops."Public transportPublic transport is one of the biggest issues for many people as they prepare to return to the office.Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, Transport Secretary Grant Shapp said increased bus and train timetables will be implemented to help the public transport system cope with an influx in passengers while still adhering to social distancing recommendations."The first thing is, obviously, we'll expand the number of trains and buses running," Mr Shapps said.He also pointed to active transport methods such as cycling as a way for people to take more personal responsibility over their welfare."The second thing to say is active travel, I think, is a very important part of this, by which I mean cycling, walking and so on," he said."There's been a massive increase ... hundreds of percent more people using the existing scheme where you can go to your employer and ask for a bike which you pay back through the loan and effectively before you pay tax, and that's a very popular scheme and I think active transport, active mobility is something we've been doing a lot more of."AirportsHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye has warned that the nation's major international airports do not have enough space for social distancing to be a solution for safe travel post-lockdown."Forget social distancing - it won't work in aviation or any other form of public transport, and the problem is not the plane, it is the lack of space in the airport," he wrote in the Daily Telegraph."Just one jumbo jet would require a queue a kilometre long."Instead, Mr Holland-Kaye believes mandatory health checks for passengers, increased levels of hygiene and compulsory face masks would be more realistic options to enable airports to reopen and air travel to resume.

Gay and bisexual men have reportedly been told they cannot donate their plasma to coronavirus trials at a London hospital.A potential treatment for Covid-19 using plasma from recovered patients is to be trialled by doctors at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.But according to current Department of Health guidelines, any man who has had sex with another man within the past three months is excluded from donating their plasma.The guidelines state: "Men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of acquiring certain infections through sex", which could be passed on during a transfusion.It comes as critical care manager Andy Roberts told ITV News that he was turned down for the plasma trial, after testing positive for Covid-19."It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer," he said.The guidelines around donating blood are set by the Department of Health on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs.They are implemented by the NHS Blood and Transplant service.A spokesman for the service told the Standard: “We will initially be using the current donor selection guidelines although we will keep this under review."The guidelines are there to protect the health of the donor and the recipient."Under the current guidelines, men must wait three months after having oral or anal sex with another man. We appreciate this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives."Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.”

Don't miss this month's supermoon — it's the last one of the year. May's "Flower Moon" will peak early Thursday morning, but will appear full for much of the week.The final supermoon of 2020 will reach its peak at 6:45 a.m. ET on Thursday, giving early risers the absolute best view, according to NASA. The moon will appear full from Tuesday night until Friday morning, so there will be plenty of opportunities to catch a glimpse.The full moon in May was called the "Flower Moon" by some Native American tribes for the large number of flowers that bloom this month, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac. It is also sometimes referred to as the Corn Planting Moon and Milk Moon, according to NASA.This year's May full moon is also called the Vesak Festival Moon, NASA says, as it corresponds to the Buddhist holiday Vesak — which honors the birth, enlightenment and passing of Gautama Buddha. The "Flower Moon" is the last in a series of four supermoons in quick succession this year. The others occurred in February, March and April. A supermoon happens when a moon is both full and closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit at the same time, according to NASA. This phenomenon makes the full moon appear "slightly" brighter and larger than normal, according to the agency.The year's final supermoon isn't the only thing to keep a lookout for in the skies this month. The Eta Aquarids meteor shower  is expected to peak early Tuesday morning — Cinco de Mayo. The show will be visible in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the best views just before dawn. It's advised to stargaze in an open area without light pollution to obstruct nature's main event. However, as the shower is peaking close to the full moon, only the brightest of shooting stars will be seen by onlookers.  
The April 26 episode of Killing Eve saw Eve ramping up her efforts to solve Kenny’s death and a fan-favorite moment of her and Villanelle sharing a kiss. There was still bloodshed however, and the brush with death and its aftermath shook Carolyn—whether she cares to admit it or hide it.Moving into the May 3 episode, Eve is back to being afraid of Villanelle, but she’s dedicated to uncovering what Kenny was investigating and the details of his murder. Yet, more bad stuff awaits her.[Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Killing Eve episode 4, “Still Got It.” Read at your own risk.]Niko is backNiko is settled in Poland with a new job delivering bread, and he seems happy hanging out at a bar and staying out of trouble.

She’s been sleeping at the newspaper office, too scared to stay home with Villanelle out there.She and Mo are at the desk doing research when she receives a bakery delivery. It’s her birthday! Scared to open the box, she takes it to the roof, much to the chagrin of Kenny’s co-workers. She opens it, and it’s a cake shaped like a double decker bus. Of course, it’s from Villanelle.Bear comes up and sees that Eve is upset. He offers to let her stay at his place after telling her she can’t sneak around and camp out at the office anymore.At his house, they share a beer and swap stories about their life choices and feelings of self-loathing. It makes her feel better. At bedtime, she receives a late-night text from Niko; it’s a selfie.Eve takes a trip, Konstantin hires VillanelleEve and Mo make progress and come across a photo from 1974 in Russia. It proves Villanelle copied a similar killing style. Their progress is interrupted when Eve receives another text from Niko, but this time it’s an invitation to visit.She leaves the office immediately to go see him and arrives at the farm where she’s working. They’re about 500 feet apart, but she calls his name and he turns toward her.Konstantin is in Moscow to spy on his child at school and scoops her up to play hooky. She tells him off and calls him out about his job, saying he only works for himself. His daughter tells him she wants him to have a plan, an exit.They part ways and he visits the accountant’s widow (the victim from episode 3). She shares that her husband left a note about a load of missing money and some files. It piques Konstantin’s curiosity, and he asks about the files while instructing her to go somewhere safe. It’s a trick.Villanelle is alone in her villa baking a cake until Dasha comes knocking. She questions her about her trip to London, and all Villanelle admits is that she saw Konstantin.Dasha scolds her about getting caught up in nonsense so she doesn’t ruin her chances of upward mobility. Dasha has a message from the higher-ups.

SpaceX completed Friday the last drop test of the Dragon crew capsule’s parachutes before the first launch of astronauts on the human-rated ship May 27, while technicians at Cape Canaveral have mated the spacecraft’s crew module with its unpressurized trunk section.The drop test from a C-130 cargo plane Friday was the 27th and final test of the “Mark 3” parachute design SpaceX will use for the Crew Dragon spacecraft. Drogue parachutes and then four main chutes unfurled from a test vehicle designed to mimic the Crew Dragon’s weight during return to Earth.SpaceX said in a tweet that the parachute test moves the Crew Dragon “one step closer” to flying NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station, “and safely returning them back to Earth.Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Dragon processing team at Cape Canaveral have connected the spaceship’s pressurized crew module with the spacecraft’s rear trunk, which generates electricity through body-mounted solar panels and houses radiators for thermal control in orbit.The parachute and spacecraft processing milestones kick off a busy month of preparations ahead of the the Crew Dragon’s launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket set for May 27 from pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The test flight will head for the International Space Station, where Behnken and Hurley will live and work for one-to-four months before returning to Earth for a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean just off Florida’s East Coast.The launch later this month will mark the first time astronauts have flown into Earth orbit from a U.S. spaceport since the retirement of the space shuttle in July 2011.“My heart is sitting right here (motioning to throat), and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station,” said Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president and chief operating officer, in a press conference Friday. “But between now and then, there’s still work to do.”NASA has awarded SpaceX more than $3.1 billion since 2011 to develop, test and fly the Crew Dragon spacecraft. SpaceX has put in its own funding, but Shotwell could not provide a figure Friday for the level of internal funds SpaceX has spent on developing the crew capsule.The public-private partnership is a hallmark of NASA’s strategy since the end of the space shuttle program to commercialize transportation to and from low Earth orbit, beginning with cargo services for the space station pioneered by SpaceX’s Dragon capsule and the Cygnus supply ship owned by Northrop Grumman, formerly known as Orbital ATK.“This is a new generation, a new era in human spaceflight,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “And when I say it’s new what I mean is, NASA has long had this idea that we need to purchase, own and operate hardware to get to space. In the past that has been true, but now, in this new era … NASA has an ability to be a customer, one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in low Earth orbit.”NASA selected Boeing alongside SpaceX in 2014 to design and build new commercial spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. Boeing’s Starliner ship is unlikely to fly with astronauts until early 2021 after an unpiloted test flight in December encountered software trouble, preventing the capsule from docking with the space station.Bridenstine said NASA and SpaceX are continuing preparations for the Crew Dragon test flight — designated Demo-2 — amid the coronavirus pandemic while introducing new physical distancing guidelines for the astronauts and support teams.“We’re going to do it in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic,” Bridenstine said. “I’m going to tell you that this is a high-priority mission for the United States of America. We, as a nation, have not had our own access to the International Space Station for nine years.”In the time since the last shuttle flight, all astronauts traveling to the space station have flown aboard Russian Soyuz capsules. In the most recent agreement with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, NASA paid the Russian government more than $80 million per round-trip seat on the Soyuz spacecraft.NASA’s inspector general last year reported the agency is paying SpaceX approximately $55 million per Crew Dragon seat.Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, said Friday that NASA and SpaceX engineers are “making sure that all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed” in preparation for the Crew Dragon launch.In parallel with hardware preparations at the Kennedy Space Center, SpaceX and NASA engineers are completing pre-flight data analyses, safety assessments and readiness reviews.The work in the coming weeks will make sure SpaceX and NASA “are ready for this important mission to safely fly Bob and Doug up to the International Space Station, serve as a lifeboat, and return them to their families,” Lueders said.“This is a humbling job,” she said. “I think we’re up to it.”Behnken, 49, will serve as joint operations commander for the Demo-2 mission, responsible for rendezvous, docking, undocking and other activities at the International Space Station. Hurley, 53, will be the spacecraft commander, responsible for launch, landing and recovery, according to NASA.Both astronauts joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 2000, and each has flown twice on space shuttle missions. Behnken and Hurley are also both married to other astronauts.“I think we have a different perspective of the importance of coming to Florida, launching again on an American rocket from the Florida coast,” Behnken said. “And generations of people who maybe didn’t get a chance to see a space shuttle launch, getting a chance again to see human spaceflight in our own backyard, if you will, is pretty exciting to be a part of.“I think that’s the thing that’s most exciting for me, as well as on my first flight, I didn’t have a small child,” he said. “I didn’t have a son, so I’m really excited to share the mission with him and have him have a chance to be old enough at six to see it and share it with me when I get home and while I’m on orbit.”Hurley piloted the shuttle Atlantis on the final space shuttle mission in July 2011.“It’s well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station, and I am certainly honored to be part of it,” Hurley said.“We would be asked questions along the lines of, well, the space program is over because the shuttle is not flying,” Hurley said. “And that certainly was not the case. We’ve had people on board the International Space Station since the fall of 2000. And we continue to fly to the space station on Soyuz vehicles. So part of it was just a lack of understanding by the public as far as what we were continuing to do as an agency, but it was also the time it took to develop new vehicles in order to take their place, take the shuttle’s place, to get folks to and from the International Space Station from the United States.”Once Behnken and Hurley return to Earth, NASA will formally certify the Crew Dragon for regular crew rotation flights to the space station, each carrying four astronauts. Another Crew Dragon is scheduled for launch later this year with three NASA astronauts and a Japanese space flier.The Dragon crew has essentially been in quarantine since March, when the threat of coronavirus interrupted daily life for millions of Americans. Behnken and Hurley will begin a formal quarantine protocol next week, then spend a few days inside a controlled facility at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston before flying to Kennedy in a NASA aircraft May 20.The astronauts will participate in a final integrated simulation Monday with NASA and SpaceX ground controllers and mission managers.“Then we start a quarantine process which escalates as we get closer to launch,” Hurley said. “And we also get some off time to kind of get everything in our lives sort of squared away since we’ve been busy getting ready for this flight, and we are likely to be in space for a few months.”“We have a few more sims with SpaceX, we’ll have some proficiency sims later on, before we go down to Kennedy,” Hurley said. “And then we’ll get down to Kennedy around six or seven days before launch and then spend the rest of the time (in Florida) prepping from that location in the astronaut crew quarters down there.”SpaceX plans a flight test readiness review May 8, followed by a NASA-led test readiness review May 11.Lueders said Friday that NASA has reviewed SpaceX’s investigation into an engine failure that occurred on a Falcon 9 launch in March. One of the rocket’s nine Merlin engines shut down prematurely during a launch with 60 Starlink Internet satellites, but the rocket overcame the malfunction and still delivered the payloads to their intended orbit.“We’re finishing testing on some other launch vehicle components,” Lueders said. “We have reviewed the anomaly resolution of the Starlink launch and actually have cleared the engines on our vehicle for that failure, so that actually is behind us right now.“But like everybody knows, the spacecraft is still processing, the launch vehicle is still processing, and as you’re processing vehicles there are little issues that come up that we have to work through,” Lueders said. “Most of our human certification activities are being completed with this mission, so the team is going through really about 95 percent of the human-rating certification on this mission.”In mid-May the Dragon spacecraft is expected to be transferred from a processing facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to the nearby Kennedy Space Center, where the crew capsule will be attached to its Falcon 9 launcher inside a hangar near the southern perimeter of pad 39A.Behnken and Hurley are scheduled to fly to Florida’s Space Coast on May 20.A test-firing of the Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled around May 22, followed the next day by a “dry dress” rehearsal when the astronauts will put on their black and white SpaceX flight suits and strap inside the Crew Dragon spacecraft at the launch pad.A launch readiness review is scheduled for May 25.On May 27, Behnken and Hurley will again put on their flight suits inside the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy, the same facility where Apollo and shuttle astronauts prepared for launch. They will ride inside a Tesla Model X from the O&C Building to pad 39A, passing by the iconic Vehicle Assembly Building and the Press Site on the way to the seaside launch complex.They will begin boarding the Crew Dragon spaceship around three hours before liftoff. SpaceX’s ground crew will close the Dragon’s side hatch and evacuate the pad before fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket with super-chilled kerosene and liquid oxygen propellants.SpaceX’s sleek crew access arm, installed on pad 39A in 2018, will retract around 42 minutes before liftoff. The Dragon’s powerful abort engines will be armed 37 minutes prior to launch, giving the astronauts the ability to escape an explosion or other emergency during fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket.Kerosene and liquid oxygen will begin flowing into the two-stage launcher 35 minutes before liftoff, which is timed for 4:32 p.m. EDT (2032 GMT) on May 27.Assuming liftoff occurs May 27, the Crew Dragon is slated to autonomous dock with the International Space Station on May 28 at approximately 11:29 a.m. EDT (1529 GMT).Hurley and Behnken will take over manual control of the spaceship at multiple points during the Dragon’s trip to the space station, testing out their ability to fly the capsule using novel touchscreen controls in the cockpit. 
The unraveling of J.Crew has spun many Twitter threads, from fans mourning the possible end of an iconic American brand to those dancing on the preppy label’s grave.J.Crew Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, saddled with $1.65 billion in debt (which is being converted into equity) and claiming that store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic will cost it $900 million in sales.The news led J.Crew to top Google GOOG, +0.46% searches and to go viral on Twitter TWTR, +4.26% as one of the first major retail casualties of the coronavirus outbreak that has essentially shut down the U.S. economy.And, as should be expected, many Twitter users had snarky reactions to the news, including posts mocking the brand’s signature preppy aesthetic, or tweets arguing that the countless small, family-owned businesses which are hanging on by a thread right now should be considered the bigger tragedy.Still others posted memes about gleefully waiting for potential J.Crew going-out-of-business sales, saying they couldn’t afford the retailer’s clothes otherwise. Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us held liquidation sales when their stores closed in 2018, after all. And retail analysts told MarketWatch that J. Crew “may have to get extremely aggressive,” which could include markdowns to help move inventory that’s been sitting on shelves since the coronavirus shutdowns began, in order to elevate cash.But many of the Twitter responses, while humorous and savage, actually have a point.Several noted that J.Crew’s financial troubles were terminal long before the pandemic struck.The company barely avoided bankruptcy in 2017 when creative director Jenna Lyons and CEO Mickey Drexler stepped down, even as sales plummeted and debt mounted. J.Crew missed the “athleisure” trend entirely.From the MarketWatch archives (June 2017): J.Crew has a new CEO, but that won’t fix its debt problemIn fact, as Eric Snyder, a partner at Wilk Auslander and chairman of the firm’s bankruptcy department, told MarketWatch on Monday: “Even if there were no pandemic, it wouldn’t have changed anything.”Read more:J.Crew was in trouble even before COVID-19 due to a big debt burden and failure to keep up with trendsOthers called out the high prices of many J.Crew pieces at a time when Americans are strapped for cash and turning to more affordable items from fast-fashion retailers like the Inditex-owned ITX, +1.48% Zara and H&M Hennes and Mauritz HNNMY, +3.23%, budget-friendly big-box stores like Walmart WMT, -0.37% and Target TGT, -2.01%, and online stores such as Amazon AMZN, -0.61%.But it’s also not surprising that the retailer’s struggle has inspired so much chatter.J.Crew has been woven in pop culture since it rolled out its mail-order-catalog collection of chinos, pocket tees and sweaters in the mid-1980s before becoming a staple of upscale shopping malls. And many shoppers bought into its mixing of formal and informal pieces. First lady Michelle Obama, who became a fashion icon during her husband’s presidential campaign and presidency, frequently dressed herself and her daughters in the brand. “Ladies, we know J.Crew. You can get some good stuff online!” she said while wearing a silk blouse, gold skirt and cardigan on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” in October 2008, for example.And former J.Crew creative director Lyons became a style icon in her own right with her signature chunky black glasses, and even made a cameo on HBO’s T, +3.14% hit series “Girls” in 2014.So, many J.Crew fans mourned the downfall of their beloved brand on social media, as well.  
Elon Musk could be serious about selling his possessions, after reports two luxury homes in California have been put up for sale.On Friday, the Tesla boss included in a series of tweets a promise to get rid of his "physical possessions".Now two properties that belong to Mr Musk are on the property website Zillow with a $40m (£32m) price tag.It comes as the maverick billionaire, 48, and Canadian singer Grimes welcomed their first child."Mom & baby all good," he announced on Twitter, a relatively restrained tweet compared with his other postings over the past few days. He said the baby was called X Æ A-12.Among Friday's tweets was a claim Tesla's value was too high - a remark which could be scrutinised by regulators. It prompted a sell-off of shares by investors, wiping $14bn from the electric carmaker's stock market value.Another tweet said his girlfriend was "mad" at him, while others bordered on the mystical. He's also been tweeting his opposition to the US coronavirus lockdown, saying in one: "FREE AMERICA NOW".Mr Musk's promise to sell his possessions included a home formerly owned by Hollywood legend Gene Wilder, and which he bought in 2013.That house, complete with pool and guest cottage, is on the Zillow website for $9.5m. The second, described as "on private knoll overlooking Bel Air Country Club and the city and ocean beyond", has a $30m sale price.The Los Angeles homes are listed as "for sale by owner", rather than with a sales agent. That led some people to wonder if Mr Musk was serious about the sales, or even if the Zillow website could have been hacked. "We don't know - everyone is trying to find out," one estate agent told the Los Angeles Times. Mr Musk is thought to own several houses in California. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that he or companies tied to him had spent $100m on seven properties in the state, many of which are close to his primary home.The birth of his son on Monday adds to the five children he has with his first wife, the Canadian author Justine Wilson.Grimes, 32, has been keeping fans updated throughout her pregnancy and in February revealed she had suffered "complications" and felt she was "woefully ill-prepared" to have a baby. Later that month she told fans on Twitter she would allow the child to choose its own gender.South Africa-born Mr Musk and Grimes (Claire Boucher) have been dating for more than two years and made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2018 Met Gala.

People freaked out a bit at the end of this week when Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted, “Tesla stock price is too high imo.” I should rephrase that: Tesla shareholders freaked out a bit.I’m offering no insight on whether the price is too high, too low, or just right — so don’t take anything here as guidance on the stock. However, a few things struck me from his statement and the response.First of all, I immediately recalled Elon saying in an interview on CNBC in August 2013 essentially the same thing. So, I wasn’t all that shocked by his tweet. He doesn’t have a problem acknowledging when he feels like the stock price has gotten a bit ahead of the company. Unfortunately, it seems that CNBC has retired that video (or, at least, the embed no longer works), but here were his comments:“I actually think that the value of Tesla right now is … I mean, the market’s being very generous, and they’re obviously giving us a lot of credit for future execution, so we’ll do our best to honor the faith the market has placed in us. … But I really feel like the valuation we’ve gotten, that we have right now, is more than, is more than we have any right to deserve, honestly. …“We need to make sure we really knock the ball out of the park in the coming years. …“Our stock price is obviously far too high based on historical financials, or even on current financials, so the value is very much based on what the future cash [inaudible] will be like.”It appears that was Elon’s basic point this week as well — not that Tesla won’t eventually achieve more and deserve an even higher stock price (he has said as much many times), just that for what Tesla has achieved to date, it appears a bit inflated.While that may be the case (who the heck knows?), one of the best arguments I’ve seen for the high stock price in the midst of this global coronavirus pandemic and economic shutdown is that there’s no really good place to park your money. Treasury bonds? No thanks. Real estate? Maybe not. An NBA team? Perhaps when you’re allowed to play basketball again. Airlines? Hotels? Amazon? Apple? Nothing is super compelling for many investors, but there is a sense among many that Tesla has an exceptionally bright future and is a good mid-term to long-term place to stash some cash. Well, I guess it’s obvious that’s what people have been deciding when you consider that Tesla’s market cap is currently double Volkswagen’s and Volkswagen is the second largest or even largest automaker on the planet in terms of volume.I’m not saying it isn’t weird for a CEO to talk smack about his own company’s share price. I thought of tweeting, “Well, it looks like Elon has joined $TSLAQ. Odd times.” But, aside from figuring few people would see my tweet and it would be a waste of time, it’s important to not distinguish between people who somehow think Tesla is headed toward bankruptcy ($TSLAQ) and people who think the stock price has gotten a bit ahead of the company (Elon). There’s actually a huge difference between those two parties — something I’m sure you wouldn’t realize if I didn’t tell you.Another thing people have noted and Elon has seemingly confirmed is that this tweet, as well as ones about selling all physical possessions (including houses), was at least somewhat meant to debunk unfriendly claims that he just wants the US to open back up because he’s a greedy, selfish bastard. Alongside that is the claim that all he cares about is the stock price, since his compensation is very much tied to how high the stock rises. I figured that was part of the reason behind these surprising tweets. Anyone who knows anything about Elon Musk, in my opinion, knows that he cares extremely passionately about the work he’s doing and probably doesn’t swim in gold coins like a certain duck — in fact, may care very little for his net worth. Who knows for sure how much he cares about his ranking among the world’s richest, but Tesla fans know that’s not what’s driving Elon on the shutdown stuff. There are plenty of other theories that make much more sense. As one final note on this part of the story, Elon also doesn’t like being perceived in what he considers an inaccurate (and negative) way.It surely bothers him that many people think and claim that he’s a greedy billionaire who does what he does in business basically only for the money. The idea is ludicrous to him.Reading responses to Elon’s tweet about the stock price, it struck me that I often forget that many Tesla fans and followers today were not following Tesla and Elon Musk years ago — in this case 7 years ago. Whereas that tweet this week immediately brought to mind his 2013 comments, a large portion of people had no idea he had said all that in public, to one of the largest media outlets in the country no less. It is perhaps wise to try to remember more often that even moderate historical context regarding Tesla may be helpful to many readers.When you take that historical commentary into account, it’s easier to see that Elon’s honesty and openness sometimes just override what’s “normal” or expected of a CEO. While the societal crisis and a coming baby may indeed be causing him some mental-emotional stress, the commentary on stock price lines up fine with things he would say at other times as well.By the way, in late August 2013, the stock price was between $140 and $170 a share. It was $701.32 at the closing bell on Friday. Elon’s comments about the stock price in August 2013 aren’t really relevant today, and his comments this week are unlikely to be very relevant (and may seem quite shocking) in 2027. Wow, it’s hard to even imagine where the company might be in 2027.As before, the company’s value today versus in several years depends on whether Tesla can “really knock the ball out of the park in the coming years.” Elon’s assessment this week on whether the stock price is tied well enough to Tesla’s current and near-term financials doesn’t really matter.(Personally, though, I wouldn’t mind a further drop in share price from such tweets since it would basically give me the opportunity to buy more stock at a lower price. But that’s just me.)
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States government had nothing to do with an alleged incursion into Venezuela that landed two US citizens behind bars in the crisis-stricken South American country.Trump said he had just learned of the detention of the pair, accused by Venezuela of being mercenaries. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said they were part of an operation to kill him that was backed by neighbouring Colombia and the US.More:Venezuela says eight killed in foiled 'invasion by sea'US indicts Venezuela's Maduro on 'narco-terrorism' chargesOpposition leader Guaido returns to Venezuela after tour"Whatever it is, we'll let you know," Trump told reporters in Washington, DC, before departing from the White House to Arizona. "But it has nothing to do with our government."Maduro said: "The United States government is fully and completely involved in this defeated raid" and praised members of a fishing village for cornering one group and netting the "professional American mercenaries".US Defense Secretary Mark Esper echoed Trump's comments later on Tuesday, saying "The United States government had nothing to do with what's happened in Venezuela in the last few days."Authorities in Venezuela identified the two detained men as Luke Denman and Airan Berry, both former US special forces soldiers associated with the Florida-based private security firm Silvercorp USA.A third US ex-Green Beret and Silvercorp founder, Jordan Goudreau, claimed responsibility for leading "Operation Gideon", which was launched with an attempted beach landing before dawn on Sunday that left eight suspected attackers dead.The two former US soldiers were detained on Monday dozens of kilometres from the first attempted beach landing in a fishing village. Authorities say they confiscated equipment and detained dozens of others.'Shoestring budget'Goudreau said the operation was designed to capture - and not kill Maduro. He said he carried it out on a "shoestring budget" after signing an agreement with US-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who Goudreau accuses of failing to pay him. Guaido denies having any relationship with Goudreau.Venezuela is gripped by a deepening social, politico and economic crises under Maduro's rule that has led nearly five million residents to flee crumbling social services, such as unreliable water, electricity and broken hospitals.The US is among nearly 60 countries that back Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader. Guaido invoked the constitution more than a year ago and declared himself interim president. Maduro, who maintains the backing of China, Russia and most of Venezuela's state institutions, including the military, accused Guaido and the US as staging a coup at the time.Venezuela and the US broke diplomatic ties a year ago, so there is no US embassy operating in Venezuela's capital of Caracas."It shocks me how insane they were," said Mike Vigil, the former head of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration. "They walked right into a coiled rattlesnake without even having minimally studied the capacity of the Venezuelan armed forces. There's no way the US government would've supported an operation like this."Guaido - often derided by Maduro as a US puppet - has cast doubt on the government's version of Sunday's events."They're trying to create a state of apparent confusion, an effort to hide what's happening in Venezuela," Guaido said in a virtual session of Congress on Tuesday, citing gasoline shortages, a deadly prison riot and a violent gang battle in Caracas. The Venezuelan government is also struggling to cope with the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. 
WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The Trump administration is drafting a legal blueprint for mining on the moon under a new U.S.-sponsored international agreement called the Artemis Accords, people familiar with the proposed pact told Reuters.The agreement would be the latest effort to cultivate allies around NASA’s plan to put humans and space stations on the moon within the next decade, and comes as the civilian space agency plays a growing role in implementing American foreign policy. The draft pact has not been formally shared with U.S. allies yet.The Trump administration and other spacefaring countries see the moon as a key strategic asset in outer space. The moon also has value for long-term scientific research that could enable future missions to Mars - activities that fall under a regime of international space law widely viewed as outdated.The Artemis Accords, named after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s new Artemis moon program, propose “safety zones” that would surround future moon bases to prevent damage or interference from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity.The pact also aims to provide a framework under international law for companies to own the resources they mine, the sources said.In the coming weeks, U.S. officials plan to formally negotiate the accords with space partners such as Canada, Japan, and European countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, opening talks with countries the Trump administration sees as having “like-minded” interests in lunar mining.Russia, a major partner with NASA on the International Space Station, won’t be an early partner in these accords, the sources said, as the Pentagon increasingly views Moscow as hostile for making “threatening” satellite maneuvers toward U.S. spy satellites in Earth orbit. The United States is a member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and sees the “safety zones” as an implementation of one of its highly debated articles. It states that celestial bodies and the moon are “not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”“This isn’t some territorial claim,” said one source, who requested anonymity to discuss the agreement. The safety zones - whose size would vary depending on the operation - would allow for coordination between space actors without technically claiming territory as sovereign, he said.“The idea is if you are going to be coming near someone’s operations, and they’ve declared safety zones around it, then you need to reach out to them in advance, consult and figure out how you can do that safely for everyone.”ARTEMIS AS ‘NATIONAL POWER’The Artemis Accords are part of the Trump administration’s plan to forgo the treaty process at the United Nations and instead reach agreement with “like-minded nations,” partly because a treaty process would take too long and working with non-spacefaring states would be unproductive, a senior administration official told Reuters.As countries increasingly treat space as a new military domain, the U.S.-led agreement is also emblematic of NASA’s growing role as a tool of American diplomacy and is expected to stoke controversy among Washington’s space rivals such as China.“NASA’s all about science and technology and discovery, which are critically important, but I think less salient is the idea that NASA is a tool of diplomacy,” NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said Tuesday.“The important thing is, countries all around the world want to be a part of this. That’s the element of national power,” Bridenstine said, adding that participation in the Artemis program is contingent on countries adhering to “norms of behavior that we expect to see” in space.NASA is investing tens of billions of dollars into the Artemis program, which calls for putting humans on the moon by 2024 and building up a “sustainable presence” on the lunar south pole thereafter, with private companies mining lunar rocks and subsurface water that can be converted to rocket fuel. The United States enacted a law in 2015 granting companies the property rights to resources they mine in outer space, but no such laws exist in the international community.Joanne Gabrynowicz, editor-in-chief emerita of the Journal of Space Law, said an international agreement must come before staking out “some kind of exclusive area for science or for whatever reason.”“It is not anything any nation can do unilaterally and still have it be legal,” she said.

The US government has distributed about 130 million economic impact payments to taxpayers in less than 30 days. The IRS anticipates sending more than 150 million payments as part of a massive coronavirus rescue package.The distribution has had some hiccups, including an overwhelmed website, payments to deceased taxpayers and money sent to inactive accounts.For those still waiting or with other questions, here are a few answers:Where is my payment?The government can’t logistically or physically make all the payments at once, so it’s doing so in steps.For those with direct deposit information on file with the IRS, based 2019 or 2018 tax return, payments began going out April 10.Payments started going out last week to Social Security beneficiaries, railroad retirees and veterans who aren’t required to file a tax return; these will continue through May. Individuals in this group will get their relief by the same method they receive their other benefits, be that direct deposit or mail.Others who are not required to file tax returns, such as low-income individuals, were encouraged to file basic information on the IRS website. Without this information, the government cannot issue a payment.Anyone who is eligible but does not have direct deposit information on file will be mailed a check. Those began to go out in late April, but that process might take several months because of distribution limitations.All payments were prioritized in order from lowest income to highest income.So, first make sure you’re eligible for a payment. If you qualify, make sure the IRS has the current and necessary information. The IRS has a Get My Payment tool on its website for people to add their direct deposit information or track the status of their payment.Why doesn’t the IRS Get My Payment tool work for me?The IRS has fixed some glitches with Get My Payment since the rollout. The experience may still not be perfect.Some taxpayers say they still cannot get past the first step of entering their basic information — name, address and adjusted gross income. The information entered must exactly match that on tax returns. Look closely for minor differences, such as spelling out Street instead of abbreviating it.Several users said they had success with putting the address in all caps, as suggested by the LA Times. The IRS says, however, that the entry line is not case sensitive. It did say removing all punctuation may help.If these fail, consider using 2018 tax return data.A word of warning: Three unsuccessful attempts to log on in one day will leave a user locked out for 24 hours as a security precaution.Why am I getting error messages on the Get My Payment tool?The “Payment Status Not Available” response has vexed many users.It means the IRS cannot determine your eligibility right now. There are a few reasons for this. First, you didn’t file a 2018 or 2019 return, or it hasn’t been fully processed. Or the site simply doesn’t have the information available yet; the agency is adding more data for use every day. It updates the information overnight daily.My dead relative got a payment. Can I keep it?It’s unclear.President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have said that these payments should be returned to the government. However, the IRS has yet to issue formal guidance, saying it’s aware of the problem and working to resolve it. Experts say because of a lag in reporting data on who is deceased, the error is almost inevitable and has occurred with past stimulus payments as well.I didn’t get a payment for my child. Why?The $500 payments only go to eligible children, generally those 16 and under. You might not get the payment if someone else can claim them as a dependent or if they’re not reflected on your most recent tax return, such as a newborn child.People who receive Supplemental Security Income or Department of Veterans Affairs benefits also don’t automatically get payments for dependents. They must add that information on the IRS website by Tuesday to get payment.If you did not receive the full amount to which you believe you’re entitled, for a child or otherwise, you’ll be able to claim the additional amount on your 2020 tax return.I don’t use (or don’t recognize) the bank account my payment went to. What now?If the account is closed or no longer active, the bank will reject the deposit and mail a check instead. It will go either to the address listed on your tax returns or the one on file with the U.S. Postal Service, whichever is most current.This is a common problem for people who got a refund anticipation loan, refund anticipation check or had their refund loaded onto a prepaid debit card. In these cases, the relief payment may have been directed to the real or virtual account associated with the product. But again, if the account is closed or inactive, it will be rejected and a check will be mailed.The IRS has corrected an earlier online error, which told users that some rejected payments were being sent to the same account a second time; they are not and will be mailed.What if I have issues?The IRS will send a letter to taxpayers about 15 days after a payment is sent letting them know how it was made and how to report issues.It also has many answers online and is updating its site regularly.If you still need a real person, you’ll have to wait. The IRS had been unable to staff its telephone lines because of the pandemic. Employees only began to return to the agency last week and it’s unclear when many services will be back up. 
Adele showed off her incredible seven stone weight loss in a tight black mini as she shared a rare Instagram post on Tuesday.The Hello singer was celebrating her 32nd birthday and stood beaming in her backyard behind a giant floral wreath.'Thank you for the birthday love. I hope you’re all staying safe and sane during this crazy time,' captioned the superstar. 'I’d like to thank all of our first responders and essential workers who are keeping us safe while risking their lives! You are truly our angels ♥️ 2020 okay bye thanks x'.Her birthday picture marked Adele's first Instagram upload since she stunned the world with her new svelte frame in photos from her Christmas party last year.Adele, who has been sticking to a 1000-a-day calorie diet and also doing Pilates, had slipped into a shimmering gown and posed up a storm beside men dressed as the Grinch and Santa Claus. Chrissy Teigen had something to say about her most recent snap and wrote: 'I mean are you kidding me,'  and The Ellen Show's Kalen Allen said: 'THAT WAIST IS SNATCHEDDDDDDD!!!!'Make-up artist James Charles posted: 'YOU LOOK AMAZING' and Burberry's Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci added, 'Happy birthday beautiful.'And Adele's fans also commented on her appearance, with one writing: 'Don't be shy drop the diet/workout routine,' while another said: 'Check how skinny she is wowowow.'Meanwhile, it was recently claimed that Adele is in a 'groove' with her new fitness regime.The singer has become increasingly health-conscious over recent months and a source close to the star praised her disciplined approach to her own wellbeing.An insider told E! News: 'She goes to different gyms. She goes early in the morning and meets with her trainer.'She gets her workout in first thing. She works out for about an hour and leaves drenched in sweat and looking like she worked very hard.'Adele reportedly attends a couple of private fitness classes every week.The source added: 'She's also staying active going on walks and getting in a lot of steps. She is in a groove.'   On Tuesday, Adele's friend Lauren Paul, 33, married to Breaking Bad actor, Aaron, 40, shared a throwback picture of them partying in Vegas with Nicole Richie. She wrote: 'Happy birthday angel babe @adele. You came into my life a few months before I had Story [her daughter], and you quickly became one of the most important figures in my journey as a new mother. 'You have taught me so much. You glow because your heart is full. I'm so proud of the human you are. Wish we were reliving this Vegas sleepover.' She also shared a picture of herself and Adele on a road trip together. Adele's friend, author and editor, Jedidiah Jenkins, shared another picture of them in a car, with Adele wearing a headscarf and chic sunglasses. In October, Adele had already visibly lost a great deal of weight as seen in pictures of her attending her friend Drake's birthday party.She posted an Instagram snap of herself at the fete and quipped in the caption: 'I used to cry but now I sweat'.In January she went on holiday to Anguilla with Harry Styles and James Corden, and met a 19-year-old fan called Lexi Larson who dished to People about their weight loss conversation. 'She said she lost something like 100 pounds, and that it’s such a crazy positive experience. She seemed so happy, and she looked amazing. She seemed really confident,' Lexi shared with the magazine.The pop superstar's big reveal came after she split from her husband Simon Konecki last April and filed for divorce in September.Adele and Simon share a seven-year-old son called Angelo and a People insider revealed her weight loss came partly from a desire to be healthier for her child.'She got to the point where she didn’t feel great. She knew she had to change something, because she wants to be the healthiest mom possible,' said the source.Pals: Adele's friend Lauren is married to Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul - they have a daughter called Story together and Lauren credits Adele with helping her as a new mother (pictured in March)The insider added: 'Her whole focus during the weight loss journey has really been all about how she can be healthier and how can she treat her body better. It was never about losing weight.' A friend previously said the split had given her a new lease of life. They told The Sun: 'Adele has been out enjoying herself and she sees that as her priority at the moment, along with being a mum to Angelo.'She has been loving her new workout regime and it really works for her. It’s a bonus that she has shifted some weight.'Her mates are glad she’s letting loose and there’s nothing but good feelings towards her. She’s got a new lease of life.'Adele and Simon first began dating in 2011 and welcomed their son the following year in 2012.The pair then married four years later, wedding in secret, with Adele choosing to address their wedding for the first time during an acceptance speech at the Grammys in 2017.Adele first confirmed her split from Simon in April, earlier this year, and filed for divorce in September, with her ex reportedly agreeing to joint custody of their son Angelo just days later. At the time, a source told People that the former couple are 'staying friendly' for the sake of their son.'They’re raising Angelo with love, warmth and real respect for each other,' the insider claimed. 'Adele and Simon are eager to stay friendly because of their child.'A month after filing for divorce, Adele was romantically linked to British rapper and Grime artist Skepta, but it was claimed their relationship was never 'serious'.In December, reports surfaced suggesting Adele has since 'grown closer' to US record producer Jonathan Hay, who she is thought to have met earlier this year in New York at Quad Recording Studios.Adele became a body positivity icon for her larger figure when she first rose to global stardom, proudly declaring on 60 Minutes in 2012: 'I don't wanna be some skinny mini with my t**s out. I really don't wanna do it.'However she became noticeably slimmer in 2016 and that year a source told the Daily Mail she was relying on the 'Sirtfood Diet.'Last year she embarked on another astonishing transformation with The Sun reporting in June that she was doing reformer Pilates with Robbie Williams's wife Ayda Field.Her new figure is also reportedly partly due to the Sirtfood Diet, which Glen Matten and Aidan Goggins debuted in a book in 2016.The diet reportedly allows Adele to indulge in red wine and coffee while stressing a regime of plant products like turmeric, kale, buckwheat and green tea.These items are said to activate a person's sirtuins, also known as 'housekeeping genes,' which suppress appetite by controlling bodily response to sugar and fat.This January Adele's former personal trainer 'Brazilian body wizard' Camila Goodis appeared on Lorraine and shed light on how the singing star took the pounds off.'She's working out but I think 90% of it is diet,' said Camila, a 31-year-old who is based out of Los Angeles.'It's a good diet to shed the weight. The first week is intense, green juices and only 1,000 calories. She doesn't look too thin - she looks amazing.'Camila told The Sun she met Adele through Ayda, who has been married since 2010 to English musician Robbie Williams of Take That fame.She theorized Adele 'has probably cut out processed foods and is eating soy and other plant-based foods.'The fitness trainer added: 'She’s found a diet that works for her. She looks younger and, more importantly, she looks happy.'Back in Februrary, a health expert on British daytime TV show, This Morning, suggested Adele's alleged '1000-calorie-a-day' diet isn't sustainable in the long term. Food writer, Dale Pinnock - aka the Medicinal Chef - warned the diet could have adverse side effects such as brain fog and irritability.  Dale explained: 'If you've got a short-term goal that kind of approach could be very, very suitable - if you want to lose weight for a wedding or holiday.'But it isn't sustainable. There will be a cut off because after a while your body will start to down regulate the things it will do.'He reminded people at home that the recommended daily intake for a woman is between 1,800 and 2,000 calories.'[The body's] top priority is survival, after a couple of weeks you won't be as active, you'll find that you get brain fog and become irritable, it kicks in quite quickly.'Slow and steady wins the race, definitely - find something that you can stick to.'This Morning's resident doctor Zoe Williams was in agreement, advising viewers to make small changes they will be able to stick to.Wellbeing & Lifestyle Consultant Yvonne Wake at Karidis Clinic recently said: 'Adele looks completely different because she has lost a lot of adipose tissue from her entire body.'We hold on to water and our bodies are highly inflamed when we are overweight.'This transformation will always show in our faces fairly quickly when we lose weight.'Her rapid weight loss will also show out as her looking so very different, but that’s just what happens when the body starts to look after itself better.'I think it suits Adele to have lost this weight, and it's healthy for her heart if done in the right way'.Last Thursday Adele's makeup artist of 12 years Michael Ashton posted an Instagram snap of her and wrote: ''BTW.... EXCITING NEWS COMING SOON!!'His cryptic caption sent fans into a tizz as they theorized that he was hinting at new music from Adele, whose most recent album 25 was released in 2015.Earlier last month Adele was Live on Instagram with producers Babyface and Teddy Riley, and as their stream got repeatedly interrupted by glitches she cracked: Come on, it's 2020 - we ain't meant to get what we want!'Although Adele's next album is slated to drop this September her quip led some fans to worry that the release may be pushed until 2021.

Updated: ABC News World News Tonight anchor David Muir landed an interview with Donald Trump during his trip to Arizona on Tuesday, and one of the bigger pieces of news out of the conversation was the president’s acknowledgement that there may be some fatal tradeoffs as states reopen their economies.Asked if lives will be lost in the desire to ease stay at home orders and other social distancing restrictions, Trump said, “It’s possible there will be some because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is. But at the same time, we’re going to practice social distancing.He added, “We’re going to be washing hands. We’re going to be doing a lot of the things that we’ve learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back. When you look at suicides. Take a look at what is going on. People are losing their jobs. We have to bring it back, and that is what we are doing.”Trump said that some people will be affected by decisions to reopen the economy in some states, as governors grapple with historic levels of unemployment.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon,” Trump said.The interview was a relatively rare instance when Trump sat down with a non-Fox network, as the president has favored the news channel and its rightward opinion hosts. But Muir took some criticism for not challenging Trump on a number of key points, including the president’s insistence that Americans will have access to testing when the country reopens.Muir, who also serves as managing editor of the newscast, did ask Trump about his frequent blaming of his predecessor, Barack Obama, for leaving an insufficient national stockpile of emergency supplies. The president has said that “the cupboard was bare,” even though that claim has been deemed “mostly false” by Politifact.Bret Baier On Co-Anchoring Donald Trump’s Next Town Hall, The President’s Media Bashing And Scrutiny Of Fox News Coronavirus Coverage — The Deadline Q&amp;AEven so, Muir queried the president on why his administration didn’t replenish it in the three years he has been in office.“Well, to be honest, I have a lot things going on,” Trump said. “We had a lot of people that refused to allow the country to be successful. They wasted a lot of time on Russia, Russia, Russia that turned out to be a total hoax. And then they did Ukraine, Ukraine, and that was a total hoax. Then they impeached the president of the United States for absolutely no reason.”Still, Trump’s claim that he inherited “broken tests” from Obama also went unchallenged. The president has made that claim before at coronavirus press briefings, but it is not entirely clear what he means, as the coronavirus had yet to exist when Obama was in office, making it impossible to create a test for it.CNN’s fact checker Daniel Dale wrote on Twitter, “A thing about Trump is that he tells the same lies over and over. I have no expectations for ‘interviewers’ from Fox, but it’s not that hard for others who get to talk to him to come prepared and willing to respond with facts.”Muir did bring up Trump’s claim, at the end of February, when he suggested that the number of coronavirus cases would go down to zero. Trump said then, “When you have 15 people and when the 15 within a couple of days is going to go down to zero. That’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”Trump responded, “You would say, worse than that I said one person, one time. And it’s true. There was a time when we had one person in this country. We knew about it. We worked on it. But we have one person, it mushroomed, the 15 people, mushroomed. Other people were coming in, also from Europe. Don’t forget.”Muir repsponded, “But we’re at more than a million cases now.”Trump said, “But don’t forget, in January — Okay, let’s talk about cases. You know why we’re at a million cases? Because we have more testing than anybody else. If we tested as much as these countries down here, okay, who don’t do very much testing at all. Look at Japan: very little testing. They’re at the bottom of the rung.”Earlier on Tuesday, Vice President Pence confirmed plans to disband the White House coronavirus task force by the end of the month, even though many health experts believe that the crisis won’t really end until  a vaccine is produced. One model showed that there could be as many as 135,000 deaths by August.“There’ll be more death, that the virus will pass, with or without a vaccine,” Trump told Muir. “And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal. But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it.”According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 71,031 deaths from coronavirus in the U.S. and 1,203,673 confirmed cases.The rest of the interview aired on Nightline and on Good Morning America on Wednesday.The full transcript is here.

China has successfully launched a new rocket and prototype spacecraft, according to state media, in a major test of its ambitions to operate a permanent space station and send astronauts to the Moon.A Long March 5B rocket took off from the Wenchang launch site on the southern island of Hainan and eight minutes later an unmanned prototype spacecraft successfully separated and entered its planned orbit, Xinhua reported. A test version of a cargo return capsule also successfully separated from the rocket, Xinhua said.China hopes that the craft will one day transport astronauts to a space station that it plans to complete by 2022 – and eventually to the Moon. It will have capacity for a crew of six.The spacecraft and capsule were slated to return to a landing site by Friday after completing their test flights, said Ji Qiming of China’s manned space agency.The United States is so far the only country to have sent humans to the Moon. But in its effort to catch up China has sent astronauts into space, satellites into orbit and a rover to the far side of the Moon in 2019.The successful maiden flight of the 54-metre Long March 5B – which has a takeoff mass of about 849 tonnes – should reassure China, following failures of the 7A model in March and 3B model in April. Beijing has launched several spacecraft since 1999 and its previous vessel, the Shenzhou, was modelled after Russia’s Soyuz.Assembly of the Tiangong space station, whose name means Heavenly Palace, is expected to begin this year and finish in 2022. It will have three modules, with living and working quarters and two annexes for scientific experiments.China plans to send an astronaut to the Moon in about a decade and then build a base there. Its lunar rover on the far side has driven about 450 metres so far.The next big mission for Beijing is to land a probe on Mars, with liftoff expected this year.

David Harris's world has shrunk to the size of his front room.Seven weeks ago he developed Covid-19 symptoms that he describes as being like a bad flu.That was when the freelance architect, 42, first began to isolate himself at the home in Bristol he shares with his wife and baby daughter.After a week or so he started to feel better, but two weeks later his symptoms returned, much to his surprise."It's been a bit of a mini-saga of a recurring wave of symptoms which I wasn't expecting at all," he said."The second wave was much worse - the same flu symptoms, but also with shortness of breath, and that's why I was confident it was coronavirus."Then I had two weeks where I thought I was getting better, I was just very tired."And then on week seven, I relapsed again and had my third wave, luckily much milder but still significant."Working on the basis it was better to be safe than sorry, David continued to self-isolate, changing into clean clothes on the rare occasions he left the front room to visit the bathroom, and eating and sleeping alone.His wife would bring their 10-month-old daughter Millie to the window of the front room so David could see her through the glass.The illness left David exhausted and uncertain what was going to happen next."Probably one of the most stressful things is trying to work out at what point you ask for help."You don't want to pester the NHS, because there are obviously people in much worse situations than me."But certainly, at my weakest moment I didn't want to fall into the trap of not asking for help and then something bad happening because you didn't ask for help."When I first relapsed, when I first got worse, it's quite a scary experience because you don't know if that means you're going down, down, down."So it is quite scary to get worse when you thought you were getting better."'It's lingering on'Allison Needham is still experiencing symptoms a month after her 'recovery' from Covid-19."The other night I constantly woke up, gasping for breath - they call it being 'air hungry'."When people say shortness of breath, it's more like you've forgotten to breathe and you have to take huge breath, literally a huge gasp."It adds to the exhaustion and for me, that's the worst thing."Her problems started with a cough over the Easter weekend which she initially thought was hay fever. But within a few days she was really ill - back and muscle pain, tender skin, severe headaches, chills.Allison ,56, has no underlying health conditions.She works for the NHS in Sheffield and so was able to get a test that confirmed she had COVID-19.She assumed she'd be better by now, but the illness lingers on."If you feel a bit better, as soon as you start to do something it knocks you off your feet again."I get a surging, burning feeling in my chest, which can be a bit scary, but I don't panic anymore."Allison feels she - and thousands like her - are not getting the help they need.A Facebook group has linked her with many others going through a similar experience - people who feel their condition is being overlooked as they struggle to regain their health."I am worried about getting back to work and how long this could go on for."I do feel people should be re-tested, even if it's just to offer reassurance that you're no longer contagious as I feel like I still have it - the symptoms are the same."Extreme agonyFelicity, 49, from London, is six weeks into her recovery after first falling ill with Covid-type symptoms.But like David, her experience has been far from smooth."I think the hardest part was having gone through the first 10 days of being very sick and thinking I was getting better, things then getting much, much worse again."So it was actually in the fifth week of being ill that my partner had to call A&E because I was experiencing such horrific abdominal pains that I was just calling out in just extreme agony."It's so difficult to know, is that the work of the virus? Is it the immune system's response? Is it ongoing inflammation?"I had no problems in my stomach before falling sick, but week five was just horrendous."Neither Felicity nor David has been tested for Covid-19, but both were told by doctors they probably had the virus.They have also been assured they are no longer infectious.But Felicity struggled to shake off her symptoms and the weeks of illness have taken their toll."I spend a huge amount of time in bed trying to recover."This entire experience, of being sick and trying to recover, has been mentally overwhelming."Most recover quicklyPart of the problem is that so much about the coronavirus is unknown, including why some people experience relatively mild symptoms lasting a few days, while other perfectly healthy people are left struggling for weeks.Dr Philip Gothard, a consultant physician at London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases, says the vast majority of patients make a full and fairly rapid recovery."Some will have a persisting cough and we're beginning to see patients who've got profound fatigue and exhaustion that goes on perhaps three, four, five or six weeks."It's very distressing if you're an otherwise young healthy person, it's something you're not used to."And so it comes as a shock that recovery is slow and stuttering."But in many patients with other diseases who are recovering from an acute illness you do tend to see this kind of waxing and waning effect as you are slowly getting better, and you have good days and bad days."Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, says data emerging from the Covid Symptom Study app shows that, on average, it takes people 12 days to start slowly recovering."We are also seeing a significant number of people reporting symptoms that can go on much longer than this, in some cases for 30 days or more."As we collect more data and continue to use machine-learning and artificial intelligence, we will soon be able to identify which combination of symptoms and risk factors make a person more or less likely to suffer from these longer terms symptoms."David and Felicity both hope they are now finally recovering and can start to return to normal life.But Covid-19, an illness that is still only a few months old, continues to spring surprises on us, and none of them welcome.

The coronavirus was circulating in France as early as December, new evidence suggests.Doctors in France discovered that a patient who went to the hospital in late December with respiratory symptoms was positive for COVID-19, according to The Guardian. The man contracted the virus nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. But it's still not clear how the man was infected, as he wasn't traveling. Doctors also can't say whether or not the man was France's "patient zero." The doctors discovered the patient while testing samples taken in December and January from 24 patients  who had all tested negative for the flu. One of the samples, taken from a patient on Dec. 27, tested positive for COVID-19.The doctors had originally collected the samples to test for the flu using a polymerase chain reaction test — the same test used to detect the new coronavirus — which searches for bits of viral genetic material. The patient, a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, likely became infected sometime between Dec. 14 and Dec. 22, according to the BBC. He presented to the hospital with a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing on Dec. 27. He was sick for 15 days and had infected his two children, but not his wife, Dr. Yves Cohen, the head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in Paris told France's BFM TV on May 3. It's too early to know whether or not this patient was France's "patient zero," he added. The patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come in contact with those arriving from China, according to the BBC. It's possible that the  patient's wife had been infected first, perhaps asymptomatically, Cohen said. “All the negative PCRs for pneumonia must be tested again," Cohen said. "The virus was probably circulating.”The French government is now working to confirm this case and will investigate further if necessary, the French health ministry told the BBC.Such early missed cases could have occurred elsewhere around the world. In the U.S., a medical examiner-coroner recently found that two people who died in Santa Clara County in California on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 had been infected with the coronavirus, weeks before the first known deaths from the coronavirus in the U.S.The very first known case of the coronavirus in the world could have occurred in November, in a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province of China, according to a previous Live Science report. That's more than a month before doctors first noted a cluster of odd pneumonia cases in the area. Though the timeline of the pandemic remains muddy, it's becoming apparent that the virus was spreading long before health care workers detected it.

Apple's new MacBook Pro addresses the previous model's biggest drawback by swapping out the controversial butterfly keyboard for the company's much-improved Magic Keyboard.But the new laptop still lags behind some Windows rivals like Dell, HP, and Microsoft when it comes to one important characteristic: its processor.The base model of Apple's new MacBook Pro that starts at $1,300 comes with an 8th-generation Intel processor — the same processor as the previous-generation model — which the chip maker initially announced in 2017. There's an option to upgrade to Intel's latest 10th generation processors, but you'll have to choose a pricier model that starts at $1,800.That makes some well-received Windows laptops look like a bargain alongside the MacBook Pro. Dell's XPS 13, which is currently Business Insider's top pick for the best overall laptop, comes in a $1,200 configuration that includes a 10th generation Intel Core i5 processor, with the option to upgrade to a more powerful Core i7 for an extra $250. HP's Spectre x360 13t also offers a 10th generation Intel Core i5 and a touch screen display for $1,120, unlike the pricier entry-level MacBook Pro. Similarly, Microsoft's Surface Laptop starts at $1,000 and comes with 10th generation Intel processors.It's worth noting, however, that the MacBook Pro does offer some advantages that these Windows options may lack, even if they are less expensive and run on newer processors than Apple's base model. The MacBook Pro, for example, has a higher resolution display (2560 by 1600) compared to the 1920 by 1080 resolution screen on the base configuration of HP's laptop.The cheapest model of Microsoft's Surface Laptop 3 also comes with 128GB of storage while the entry-level MacBook Pro comes with 256GB. But overall, the Surface Laptop 3 still offers more power for the same price considering the configuration that's priced similarly to Apple's $1,300 MacBook Pro has a 10th-generation Intel processor and offers the same amount of storage.The new MacBook Pro, other than its much improved keyboard, increased storage capacity, and 10th generation Intel processors for the higher-end models, doesn't seem to be much different than its predecessor.It's not nearly as drastic as the changes we've seen come to Apple's larger-sized MacBook Pro at the end of 2019. The bigger MacBook Pro now has a more expansive 16-inch screen with slimmer bezels compared to the older 15-inch model. It also comes with the Magic Keyboard, improved microphones and speakers, and new storage and memory options. The latest MacBook Pro seems like a move by Apple to make its new Magic Keyboard standard across all of its laptops rather than providing a major upgrade to the 13-inch Pro. Several reports from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg suggest that Apple is planning some significant changes to its MacBook Pro line over the coming months heading into 2021.These could include a new 14-inch model that will likely serve as the smaller counterpart to Apple's 16-inch model, the first Apple laptop to run on its own processors rather than Intel's, and laptops with mini-LED displays that offer better contrast. Should these reports turn out to be true, the newly announced MacBook Pro could be an iterative update ahead of what is shaping up to be a larger refresh.

The author of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's much-anticipated biography Omid Scobie has admitted it feels nice to 'finally be able to talk about' the project he's been 'beavering away at quietly for two years'.British journalist Omid Scobie, who has accompanied Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 38, on a variety of royal tours, took to the podcast The Heir Pod to discuss the release of the book.Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family is set to be released worldwide online on August 11, with the hard copy on sale from August 20 and was released to pre-order over the weekend. And Omid admitted that their tale has included twists and turns that 'even the Sussexes didn't expect'. Speaking about finishing the biography, he said: 'It's been a long time in the making. The last few weeks have been quite a challenge getting it all ready in time for the deadline.He added: 'This project started about two years ago, and there have been twists and turns that no one expected. This is something no one expected.'I don't even think Harry and Meghan, who by their own account struggled with the realities of the situation, expected things to turn out the way they did.'Explaining that the biography gives a real inside account of their story, he said: 'I've been on so many engagements and around them as much as possible, and spoken to so many people in their lives, so no stone has been left unturned.'I've seen the couple remain faithful in their own beliefs and stand strong in the face of adversities which have been publicly played out in the press, and I would like to think this tells the definitive version of their lives together.' Publishing house Harper Collins, which owns Dey Street Books, the publisher of the biography released a brief description of Meghan and Prince Harry's collaboration with the two journalists.The book's description says that 'few know the true story of Harry and Meghan'. It promises to go 'beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan's life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond'.It continues: 'With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.'The cover features a beaming Prince Harry and Meghan as they visited their namesake county in October 2018 for the first time.  The Mail on Sunday were told that before moving to North America, the Sussexes gave an interview to the book's authors, both journalists.One of them, Omid Scobie, is thought to be close to Meghan and was one of the favoured journalists given details of the couple's video call to the Queen last week in which they wished her a happy 94th birthday. Echoing Princess Diana's secret involvement in the blockbuster biography, Diana: Her True Story, when she encouraged her friends to speak to author Andrew Morton, questions are being asked whether members of Meghan's inner circle were being urged to help Scobie and his American co-author, Carolyn Durand. The 320-page biography, due to be released in August, is expected to be a global bestseller.  
Premier League matches could last less than 90 minutes when the season resumes, according to PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor.Top-flight officials are considering a number of measures to improve the safety of players and staff amid the coronavirus crisis, including neutral venues and extra substitutes in every game.And now Taylor has claimed that another radical proposal to shorten each half is on the table ahead of showdown talks on Project Restart.'We don't know the future, what we do know is what propositions have been put forward and ideas. More subs, games possibly not being full 45 minutes each way, neutral stadiums, there's lots of things put forward.'We're trying to wait to see what the proposals are and have the courtesy to let the managers and coaches and players assimilate all those and come to a considered view.' Questioned on whether the idea of having more substitutes would negate the need to shorten matches, Taylor added: 'There's a lot of possibilities. Ideally you want to keep the integrity of the competition and of course that was about playing home and away, that's about having the same squad of players before it was suspended.'There's lots of points to be made, but above all can the seasons be completed, as long as it takes, and above all can it be completed safely.'On the prospect of games being shortened, EFL chief Rick Parry said on Tuesday that there hadn't been any specific discussions about it that he was aware of.Speaking via videolink to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee he said: 'Talks have been held on increasing subs to five, the aim (of shortening matches) could only be to reduce the strain on the players, who are coming abck after a fairly long time away. I don’t think we should be ruling out any creative ideas at the momemt, I haven’t heard that one before but no reason it should not be added to things to disucss. 'We would have a crammed fixture schedule so perhaps the thinking is that it would alleviate the tiredness, help with recovery and lessen likelihood of injuries. I guess that is what Gordon’s thinking was but we haven’t studied it.'Last week, Sergio Aguero revealed that he and the 'majority' of players are scared about returning to action too early and putting their friends and family at risk.Asked what he thought about the Manchester City star's comments and whether the players he represents had a right to be afraid, Taylor, 75, said: 'Sergio is a top-class player and he is entitled to his opinion. 'It's not a question of being scared, it's a question about being fully informed for the relevant authorities to ensure it's as safe as it can be to return and to pick out any particular statements or choose any parts of that process. It's not fair until you look at the whole menu.'Are you trying to say my players are frightened to return? They're professional sportsmen and women, and of course they're concerned about their own safety, they're not stupid and not naive so they would have to be satisfied it's safe to return and it's their choice.'Taylor, who denied that teams involved in the relegation battle want the current season to be cancelled, insists that a return to action in June remains the target. 'The very fact that you're in a professional sport, you need to be very resilient and bounce back because you'll get more setbacks,' he added.'I like to think that's how my members are. It remains in process and we will wait and see and take it on a day-by-day basis and see if it's achievable but if we don't try then it's never going to be achievable. 'If everything looks promising, you wouldn't be thinking of matches being played middle of June, I would estimate.'

North and South Korea exchanged gunfire over the demilitarised zone between the two nations, South Korean military officials have said.The exchange began when North Korean soldiers shot at a South Korean guard post at 7.41 am local time on Sunday. The South Korean military shot back twice, Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.No casualties or equipment damage were reported on either side.South Korea’s military confirmed it found four bullets lodged in the outer wall of a guard post and that its forces fired 10 warning shots towards North Korea. Messages of warning were broadcast to North Korea which said that it had violated the inter-Korean military agreement of 2018 under which the two countries agreed to halt all hostile activities at the border.South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said they sent a message to their North Korean counterparts via a hotline to find out more about the situation and to prevent further escalations. So far, North Korea had not offered an explanation.Speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, a South Korean military official also said the shots from North Korea did not seem to have been intentional.“Visibility was poor due to a thick fog and the shots were fired at the time of a guard change across the border which is when they check their weapons. So, although it was a clear violation of the agreement, chances are it was unintentional. They would have done it in better weather conditions if it had been intentional. Also, North Korean farmers were working their land looking unruffled before and after the shooting.”The exchange of fire came a day after North Korea broadcast images of Kim Jong-un reappearing in public after a 20-day absence amid intense speculation about his health.KCNA said the North Korean leader attended Friday’s ceremony marking the completion of a fertiliser factory near Pyongyang, along with senior officials. State TV showed Kim smiling and walking around factory facilities.Kim had vanished from the public eye after presiding over a politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ party on 11 April to discuss the coronavirus. Speculation about his health began after he missed an event on 15 April commemorating the birthday of his grandfather and state founder, Kim Il-sung, something he had never done since inheriting power in late 2011.Kim Jong-un did not have surgery during his absence from public life, the South Korean news outlet Yonhap said on Sunday, citing a senior government official. The South Korean official declined to provide reasons for believing that Kim did not undergo surgery, but said speculative reports that he may have had surgery, citing some differences in his leg movements, were not true, Yonhap reported.The demilitarised zone between the two Koreas was established as a buffer following an armistice after the end of the Korean war in 1953. Contrary to its name, it is one of the most heavily guarded borders in the world and skirmishes have broken out between the two countries in the area for decades.The two Koreas started dismantling frontline guard posts in late 2018 thanks to improved relations but efforts have been halted recently after negotiations to denuclearise North Korea broke down over disagreements regarding the end of US sanctions.South Korean military said it had ordered all farming activities in the area to be halted and was analysing North Korean bullets found at the scene.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the shots were thought to have been “accidental.”“Handful of shots came across from the north; we think those were accidental,” he said on ABC’s This Week. “South Koreans did return fire. There was no loss of life on either side.”
A PROBE into how factors such as ethnicity and obesity can affect vulnerability to Covid-19 has been ordered by the Health Secretary.Deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are said to be disproportionately high.It comes as Britain's ethnic minorities are suffering a vastly higher proportion of coronavirus deaths, figures show.Covid-19 has killed 33 white people per 100,000 in English hospitals but 89 per 100,000 of black Caribbean descent, says NHS England.A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies also showed deaths of British black Africans are 3.5 times those of white Brits, and Brit Pakistani deaths are 2.7 times higher.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: "We recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away especially among care workers and those in the NHS."Deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam, who said people would have noticed he was from an "ethnic minority group", added that the issue was being taken "incredibly seriously".Disproportionate numbers"We will get to the bottom of this however long it takes us," he said.Mr Hancock added that data has also shown there could be a relationship between obesity and the impact of Covid-19 on individuals.It comes after researchers at the University of Liverpool warned last week that obesity increased the risk of dying from the virus by 37 per cent.He added: "Our knowledge about this virus grows daily and it appears some groups are more affected than others."Emerging data from around the world suggests there could possibly be a relationship between obesity and the impact of Covid-19 on individuals."It's too early to say if obesity in itself is a factor or conditions associated with it – or there is not enough data yet to rule it out – so we need to approach any assumptions with caution."Every death from this virus is a tragedy and behind each statistic is a name, a loss and a family that will never be the same again."The review will analyse how factors such as ethnicity, gender and obesity can affect people's vulnerability to coronavirus.Public Health England (PHE) said thousands of health records of people who have had Covid-19 will be examined to establish more "robust" data on what can impact the number of cases and health outcomes for different groups within the population.The findings of the PHE-led review will be published at the end of the month.We owe it to the nation to find out how this virus may affect different groups in different waysMatt HancockHealth SecretaryMr Hancock said: "As part of our continued effort to reduce health inequalities, we have commissioned PHE to consider various factors such as obesity, ethnicity, age, gender and geographical location, and how these may have an impact on someone's susceptibility to the virus, including our brilliant key workers and frontline NHS and social care staff."It's an extremely important and hugely complex task, but we owe it to the nation to find out how this virus may affect different groups in different ways, to protect lives and limit the spread of the disease."PHE said available data on health outcomes for NHS staff will also be analysed to better understand how the virus affects frontline workers.The review will also look at vulnerable groups such as people who are homeless and rough sleeping, it added.It will be led by Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE public health director for London, who said: "Detailed and careful work is being done so that we can better understand this and explore the possible reasons for any disparities."Increasing evidence and concern around the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic groups highlights an important focus of this review."PHE is rapidly building robust data and undertaking detailed analysis to develop our understanding of the impact of this novel coronavirus on different groups which can inform actions to mitigate the risks it presents."The review will also match laboratory records of coronavirus cases to existing health records to compile accurate data such as ethnicity and describe the association with Covid-19 cases, alongside other factors such as sex, age and geographical location, PHE said.The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it was "extremely concerned" about the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME health and care workers.We cannot wait for the data to catch up while people are dyingDame Donna KinnairChief Executive The Royal College Of NursingIts chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair said: "Every day that passes without knowing why this happening is another day with frontline staff being needlessly put at extra risk."All healthcare workers need to be safe right now, and that means that all employees must risk assess BAME employees, including ensuring provision of the right PPE for everyone who needs it."We will continue to call for accurate reporting of the numbers of deaths and infections among BAME healthcare staff across the UK so that swift action can be taken by employers to reduce risk and harm. But we cannot wait for the data to catch up while people are dying."Trevor Phillips, ex-chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “They say viruses don’t discriminate.“But the faces of those who have died saving lives tell a very different story.“We won’t know the truth about coronavirus until we treat this question with the same seriousness we treat the search for a vaccine.”Heroic medics who have died on the front line are also disproportionately from an ethnic minority.Britain's coronavirus death toll, rose to 28,734 yesterday - second only to Italy's among European nations.

Mr Gove said the public had shown “amazing stoicism and understanding” about changes imposed to deal with the killer disease. Speaking in Downing Street, he said the country was facing a “new normal” that would mean staggered use of public transport and other measures as the government takes a cautious approach to change the rules.Ultimately, unless and until we have a new vaccine, I suspect we are going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.”Official figures yesterday showed 28,446 people with coronavirus have now died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, up by 315 on the day before.Around 76,500 tests had been produced in the latest daily round.Changes will be made to lockdown in stages to allow the experts to monitor the impact carefully of lifting measures.Mr Gove said: “A phased approach is one which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health and if necessary, in a specific and localised way, that means we can pause or even reintroduce those restrictions that might be required in order to deal with localised outbreaks of the disease.”

Good Morning Britain 's Dr Hilary Jones has confirmed Piers Morgan "doesn't have symptoms normally associated with Covid-19" but got tested as a "precaution".The newsman, 55, has stepped away from the show after falling sick over the weekend and won't be returning until gets his test result back.Dr Hilary has now revealed he spoke to Piers yesterday and the GMB host explained his symptoms over the phone.The TV medic admits what Piers described is not usually linked to Covid-19, but he took the test anyway just to be safe.Speaking on GMB today, Dr Hilary said: "I spoke to Piers yesterday and he doesn't have symptoms that are normally associated with covid-19 but as he says, with an abundance of caution, he's taken a test."He was replaced by Ben Shephard on today's show, who joked: "Does he just want a lie-in, Hilary?"The doctor then quipped: "I think he probably wants to get his car clean".Just weeks ago, Piers clashed with Dr Hilary after the medic told him the lockdown rules means he can't go outside to clean his beloved car.Piers said: "Can I wash my Aston Martin in the street? The windows are all getting filthy and I have to drive myself to work."I imagine there's a lot of people out there who are driving, not Aston Martins, but vans, lorries."What is the rule? There are no car washes open. Are you allowed under government guidelines to wash your car?"Dr Hilary insisted that no one should be washing their car on the street as it poses an unnecessary risk.The doctor said: "Washing your car is unessential apart from the windscreen for safety. Leave your car dirty for the timebeing."On Sunday, Piers told fans he'd have to take a step back from GMB after suffering mild symptoms and was awaiting the result of a test.He tweeted: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs..."I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."Piers didn't go into what symptoms he had experienced, but did reveal he was going by medical advice.His colleague Susanna Reid was forced to miss two weeks of GMB in March, after her son came down with a cough.On this morning's GBM, Pies was replaced by Ben Shephard, who introduced the show saying: "As you can see, I'm not Piers!""Yes, it's therapeutic," Susanna quipped.Susanna added: "We send our very best wishes and we'll be on our best behaviour while he's not here." 
Countries across the Asia-Pacific region have announced plans to cautiously reopen for business as governments around the world race to reboot economies devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.Hong Kong, South Korea and Australia have all vowed to get their residents back to school and work in the coming days as Covid-19 infection rates slow. Financial markets have become caught between concern about cratering economies and rising US-China tension, and the prospect of more countries reopening for business.On Tuesday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, announced plans to reopen schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours from Friday, with authorities set to hand out reusable face masks to all 7.5 million residents. Hong Kong has had 1,041 cases of coronavirus with four deaths.The move comes after the territory’s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, recorded its worst decline on record. GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.In South Korea, once the worst-hit country outside China, the government relaxed social distancing rules on Wednesday and students will return to school from Monday. The country, with more than 10,800 cases and 255 deaths, has been held up as an example of how to contain the virus. On Wednesday the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported two new cases – both imported – as the number of new infections continued to slow.The education minister, Yoo Eun-hae, said high school seniors, who are preparing for highly competitive university entrance exams, would return to schools on 13 May with younger students to follow in phases from 20 May.Students and teachers will have to wear a mask except during mealtimes, wipe their desks and observe social distancing as they move around. Schools will also be required to regularly disinfect their premises, conduct temperature checks and rearrange seating.The South Korean professional baseball season began on Tuesday, although teams played in empty stadiums, and football is to follow suit on Friday.Thailand, which has seen 2,987 cases and 54 deaths, began easing restrictions on movement and gatherings on Monday, allowing restaurants, hair salons and open-air markets to resume business, provided that social distancing is maintained and proprietors carry out temperature checks. In neighbouring Vietnam, which has had 271 cases and no deaths, life is also gradually returning to normal, but the economy, which relies on tourism for a 6% of its GDP, faces huge challenges.The Australian government on Wednesday said it was seeking ways to reopen locked down businesses as early as July, as its success in containing the coronavirus outbreak allows it to focus on trying to regain a million jobs lost since mid-March.Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and state leaders will discuss health protocols at a national cabinet meeting on Friday that could enable businesses to open in a “Covid-safe environment”, with the government saying the shutdown has been costing the economy A$4bn a week.“The lesson from history … is that the quicker you can get people back into jobs and off those unemployment queues, the better off the economy will be and the better off those individuals will be,” the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told ABC television.There would be three stages to easing restrictions on social distancing for affected industries, with cafes, restaurants and retail expected to be among the first to be allowed to reopen. Each state would move at its own pace with the common goal of having most of their economies rebooted by July. Australia has had fewer than 7,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and there are fewer than 1,000 active cases remaining. Ninety-six people have died in the outbreak.The resumption of business might also coincide with the opening of the border between Australia and New Zealand, creating what has been dubbed a trans-Tasman “travel bubble”, given that both countries have significantly reduced infection levels and rates.In the US, the Trump administration is also pushing for an end to lockdowns to focus on economic growth, despite the nation leading the world in infections and deaths, and experts warning that the worst is yet to come. President Donald Trump has scrapped daily coronavirus task force briefings and marginalised his medical experts, preferring economic officials to publicly urge states to reopen.Chinese stock indices reopened in positive territory on Wednesday after the spring holiday but the Australian market lost 0.6% and futures trading pointed to a similar drop in London and New York later in the day. Disney cast a pall over Wall Street by announcing losses of $1.4bn in the first quarter and the entertainment company still had no indication when it might reopen its profitable theme parks in Europe and the US. Airbnb, the home booking site, said it was cutting 1,900 jobs amid the worldwide travel slump.In other coronavirus developments:Britain has overtaken Italy to become the worst-hit nation in Europe, and the second-worst in the world, with more than 32,000 deaths.Youth unemployment in Britain will reach 1 million people over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns.The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a “devastating” surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths by 2025, new research shows.Brazil confirmed its highest daily coronavirus deaths on Tuesday. There were 6,935 new cases since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April.Mexico’s president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, signalled some automotive factories could open in coming weeks.After two consecutive days of zero new coronavirus cases, on Wednesday New Zealand reported one new case of the virus and one more death. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said success in curbing Covid-19 had provided a “safe haven” advantage allowing the country to be open for investment. 
States across the country are moving swiftly to reopen their economies despite failing to achieve benchmarks laid out by the White House for when social distancing restrictions could be eased to ensure the public’s safety during the coronavirus pandemic.These governors’ biggest cheerleader is President Trump.A slew of states — such as Texas, Indiana, Colorado and Florida — have pushed forward with relaxing social distancing guidelines even as the number of people testing positive in many states has increased in recent weeks and testing continues to lag behind. White House recommendations released last month encouraged states to wait to see a decline in cases over a two-week period, as well as having robust testing in place for front-line workers before entering “Phase One” of a gradual comeback.But Trump and some of his aides have backed away from their own guidelines, opting instead to hail the broad economic reopening that health experts say has started too quickly. The dichotomy comes as the White House also tried to distance itself from a draft federal government report predicting an explosion of new coronavirus cases and 3,000 daily deaths by June 1.It underscores how an eagerness by Trump and several state governors to begin restarting normal activities after a weeks-long economic slowdown has clashed with a stubbornly high national caseload that has defied the president’s predictions of a swift and safe reopening. It also marks another round of confusing guidance from Trump, who released the guidelines with fanfare during a briefing and now shows no problem with states that ignore them.“There’s not too many states that I know of that are going up. Almost everybody is headed in the right direction,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Sunday, in which he presented a misleading and rosy assessment of the crisis. “We’re on the right side of it, but we want to keep it that way, but we also want to get back to work.”In reality, new coronavirus cases are increasing in about a third of states, compared with just a few where there has been a sustained decline. A plurality of states are hovering around the same level, with neither a significant uptick nor decrease in daily cases. That mirrors the national trend, as the rate of new cases has leveled off in recent weeks but not declined.Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said most governors who have decided to open up are clearly not following the letter of the White House guidelines.“The first part of the criteria is sustained decline. And we don’t see that,” Jha said.To date, 1.2 million people have been infected by the coronavirus and more than 68,000 have died in the United States. Both figures are widely believed to undercount the actual totals.The White House continues to support its guidelines but wants local officials to take the lead in deciding how quickly to ease restrictions, according to a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. While individual states’ decisions to move more quickly than recommended under the White House guidelines are regularly discussed during coronavirus task force meetings, those decisions are not seen as defiant toward the Trump administration, the official said.One reason could be that Trump rarely discusses his own guidelines, instead encouraging states to move quickly to reverse the economic calamity that took hold as governors imposed stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus. Trump has expressed support for protesters pushing their states to end the orders and tweeted about a need to “LIBERATE” several states — including places that White House guidelines indicate should remain in a state of lockdown.Politically, governors have come to learn they are more likely to be criticized by Trump for maintaining stay-at-home orders that comply with White House guidelines than they are for opening up their economies before meeting the Trump administration’s own criteria for doing so.Trump has singled out Virginia for its reluctance to quickly ease social distancing measures, telling Fox News that it was one of the states that “aren’t going fast enough.”Even though the number of coronavirus cases in Virginia continues to rise, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced Monday that he would probably begin easing the state’s restrictions on May 15 — including by allowing some gatherings of more than 10 people if social distancing protocols are met.“As you can see, our cases continue to rise,” he said, before adding that the state’s percentage of positive tests — another key measure in the White House guidelines — had begun to decline.Trump’s light criticism of Georgia’s decision to begin opening up businesses including barbershops and bowling alleys before meeting White House benchmarks was short-lived.While the president said on April 23, he was “not happy” with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) for the defying the guidelines, it took him only a week to deny his own remarks.“I didn’t say that,” Trump said Friday when his quote about Kemp was read back to him. “I said I didn’t like the particular place — a spa, a tattoo parlor. No, no, I think it’s wonderful.”As Trump leads the nation’s push for a quick economic reopening, some administration officials have continued to call on states to follow the White House’s detailed guidelines.Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, has repeatedly warned governors against moving too quickly to lift restrictions, saying he was concerned that states that flout the White House guidelines could spark a resurgence of the virus.“The guidelines are very, very explicit, and very clear,” he said last week on NBC’s “Today” show. “There’s a lot of leeway because we give the governors the opportunity to be very flexible, but you have to have the core principles of the guidelines. You can’t just leap over things and get into a situation where you’re really tempting a rebound.”Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, has also called on states and localities to follow the administration’s guidelines but has stopped short of contradicting Trump’s push for governors to move as quickly as possible to return to normal.“We made it very clear that the guidelines are based on very strong evidence and data,” she said Sunday on Fox News. “We’ve made it clear what the gating criteria is.”Several governors have ignored that criteria.In Texas, for instance, new cases dipped in mid-April but have lately been on the rise, with a spike late last week to more than 1,000 daily that has brought the total to more than 32,000. Nonetheless, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) went ahead with a plan to reopen the state’s stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls provided they operate at less than 25 percent capacity.Lauren Ancel Meyers, a University of Texas at Austin biologist who has modeled possible trend lines in the state’s capital as social distancing requirements are eased, said much will depend on how vigilant people remain with social distancing.Models of potential transmission in Austin that she has run range anywhere from “hardly any additional hospitalizations” to “a catastrophic second wave.”Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) let his stay-at-home order expire last week and replaced it with a far less restrictive set of rules that allow restaurants, shops and fitness centers to open in nearly all parts of the state. Hair and nail salons, which weren’t part of the original reopening, will be allowed to begin service again this week. That’s despite the fact that new cases have jumped in recent days and now total more than 13,000.Some public officials have been unnerved at the speed with which the reopening has happened and the apparent disregard for guidelines set by medical experts.“The state policymakers believe that the economic climate is more important than those guidelines,” said Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke (D). “I don’t see any other explanation.”But as states have defied that criteria to begin restarting business activity — from retail stores in Colorado to restaurants in Florida to elective surgeries in Ohio — they have been cheered on by Trump and his allies.Vice President Pence has hailed the 41 states that have announced or began plans for reopening.But some of those states have pushed ahead with reopening plans that skip ahead of the White House’s recommended phased approach. The recommendations call for certain testing and contact tracing capabilities to be in place before states push forward with returning to normalcy.A lack of planning on those fronts could leave states vulnerable if there is another outbreak, said Jeffrey Shaman, one of the country’s leading epidemiologists at Columbia University.“We don’t have the testing. We don’t have the contact tracing. We can’t detect a rebound,” he said. “It’s a really problematic place to be. This is not where we want to be.”Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska, said the governors are clearly reacting to “shelter-in-place fatigue” as they skirt the guidelines. But he said that’s a risky bet, given the danger that the virus comes roaring back.There is widespread uncertainty about what will happen as states race to ease their restrictions on residents and businesses. A draft government report projects coronavirus cases will surge to about 200,000 per day by June 1, a staggering jump that would be accompanied by more than 3,000 deaths each day.The document predicts a sharp increase in both cases and deaths beginning about May 14, according to a copy shared with The Washington Post. The forecast stops at June 1 but shows both daily cases and deaths on an upward trajectory at that point.The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disavowed the report, although the slides carry the CDC’s logo. The creator of the model said the numbers are unfinished projections shown to the CDC as a work in progress.The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in a statement called the report a “preliminary” analysis that should not be used as a forecast.Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School who created the model, said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility, an indication that coronavirus cases could spiral out of control at the same time the White House has shifted focus toward reopening the economy. Much depends on political decisions being made today.“There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,” Lessler said.The White House downplayed the figures on Monday, saying they had not yet been vetted.“This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force, or data that the task force has analyzed,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.White House officials have been relying on other models to make decisions on reopening, including one from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and a “cubic model” prepared by Trump adviser and economist Kevin Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers.People with knowledge of the “cubic model” say it shows deaths dropping precipitously in May — and plummeting to zero by May 15, where they stay throughout the summer.Two people with knowledge of the White House task force discussions said that they had not seen the draft government report but that they were both fearful cases could rise with many of the states reopening.The IHME model is now estimating America will reach nearly 135,000 deaths by Aug. 1. That number is significantly higher than its estimate on April 17 of 60,308 deaths.IHME’s new higher projections “reflect the effect of premature relaxation of restrictions,” said its creator, Christopher Murray. “In this era where those mandates are being relaxed, people should be aware the risk of infection is still there.” 
The Monday Market MinuteGlobal stocks slump as investors fret over the potential for trade conflict as the U.S. and China bicker over the origins of the coronavirus.President Donald Trump again raises the prospect of China reprisals while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says there is "enormous evidence" the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan.Factory data around the world paints an historically grim picture of April output, with European PMI levels falling to 33.4.The U.S. dollar books solid gains as traders adopt a defensive tone heading into the week, which will see 156 S&P 500 companies reporting alongside factory output, weekly jobless and April employment data. U.S. states move to re-start regional economies, with 22 expected to lift or ease stay-at-home restrictions over the next ten days.Wall Street futures suggest a weaker open ahead of earnings from Wynn Resorts and Skyworks as well as factory output data at 9:45 am Eastern time.U.S. equity futures slumped lower Monday, while oil traded firmly in the red and the dollar trended higher, as investors grew increasingly unsettled by the prospect of a bitter debate between Washington and Beijing over the origin of the coronavirus and factory data painted a grim picture of its economic damage in the world's biggest markets.In a virtual town hall late Sunday, Trump again raised the idea of reprisals against China for its lack of transparency during the early stages of the outbreak, which has now risen to 3.5 million people around the world and caused at least 250,000 deaths. He also suggested the U.S. could "terminate' the January trade deal with China, and said tariffs were "at a minimum are the greatest negotiating tool that we have ever devised."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in fact, went one step further, telling Sunday media that there was "enormous evidence" that the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, had emerged from a virology lab in the city of Wuhan.The potential for a renewed trade war between the world's two biggest economies could overshadow any market benefit from the re-start of business and factory activity in the United Sates, where at least 22 states are set to either lift of relax "stay-at-home" orders over the next ten days.Factory data from around the world Monday, as well, suggested some of the worst monthly downturns on record, with activity in Europe slumping to an all-time low of 33.4 points over the month of April. With corporate earnings slated to decline 12.7% over the first quarter, and a further 37.8% over the three months ending in June, investors may struggle to take stocks higher in the days ahead as more economic benchmarks reveal the scale of the coronavirus damage and Friday's April employment report tallies the cots to the U.S. jobs market.With that risk in the window, U.S. equity futures were trading firmly lower to start the week, with contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicating a 235 point opening bell decline and those linked to the S&P 500 suggesting a 21 point pullback for the broader benchmark.Airline shares were notable pre-market movers Monday after billionaire investors Warren Buffett told investors over the weekend that he's dumped all his holdings in the sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Delta Air Lines DAL, one of the four carriers Buffett exited last month, was marked 10.7% lower in pre-market trading Monday to indicate an opening bell price of $21.88 each. It's main domestic rivals, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL, were marked 11.7% and 10.3% lower respectively, while U.S.-focused Southwest Airline LUV was seen 7.9% lower at $27.10 each.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies and has lately been seen as a useful indicator for risk market sentiment, traded 0.3% higher at 99.358 in overnight dealing as investors plowed cash into safe haven assets. That pushed 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields lower, to around 0.613%, in early European trading.European stocks kicked-off their May campaign on a sour note, with traders returning from their May Day holiday Friday to take the Stoxx 600 2.5% lower, lead to the downside by a 3.2% slump for the trade-sensitive DAX performance index, while Britain's FTSE 100, which was open for trading on Friday, fell 0.20%.“Euro area manufacturing output plunged to an extent greatly exceeding any decline previously seen in the near 23-year history of the PMI survey in April, reflecting a combination of factors including widespread factory closures, slumping demand and supply shortages, all linked to the COVID-19 outbreak," said Markit's chief economist Chris Williamson.Global oil prices were on the back foot, as well, following last week's surge, which was largely driven by speculative buying after prices hit near record lows amid concerns over a glut of supply and a lack of storage facilities for unwanted crude.Front-month WTI futures contracts for June delivery, the new benchmark for U.S. prices, were last seen $1.44 lower from their Friday close in New York and changing hands at $18.34 per barrel.Brent futures for July delivery, which benchmark around 60% of global crude purchases, were marked 73 cents lower at $25.71 per barrel.Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was shut for Children's Day, one of the country's traditional early May holidays, sapping liquidity around the region and leaving the U.S. dollar to mop-up the risk-averse moves in currency markets. The region-wide MSCI ex-Japan index, meanwhile, was seen 1.6% lower heading into the close of trading, although a weaker yuan again helped lift China's Shanghai Composite to a 1.3% gain even as Hong Kong slumped 4.2% and the South Korean KOSPI fell 2.7%.
Mobile operator O2 may be set to merge with broadband giant Virgin Media to create one of the country's largest entertainment and telecoms firms.A tie-up between two big players in Britain's telecoms and media sector would create a major rival to BT.Spanish firm Telefonica, which owns O2, confirmed that it was in talks with Virgin-owner Liberty Global.The company stressed that the negotiations were ongoing and there was no guarantee they would reach a deal."The process initiated by both parties is in a negotiation phase, not being able to guarantee, to this date, neither the precise terms nor the probability of its success," Telefonica said.Virgin Media declined to comment.O2, which provides the network for Tesco Mobile, Giffgaff and Sky Mobile, is the UK's largest phone company with around 34 million users.Virgin has about six million broadband and cable TV customers and another three million mobile users.A tie-up between the two would increase pressure on BT, which owns the UK's second-largest mobile network EE.BT has 28 million mobile, TV and broadband customers across the country. It also provides services to a million businesses.Telefonica tried to sell O2 to the owner of Three, CK Hutchison, for £10.3bn in 2015. However, that deal was blocked by the European Commission over concerns that it would have left just three major mobile phone operators in the UK.But telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore, who works for PP Foresight, does not think a deal between O2 and Virgin would face similar hurdles.He said Virgin Media mainly provided services through cable, such as broadband and TV, whereas O2 focuses on mobile."It's very much complementary," he said.Describing what a tie-up between the two companies could look like, Mr Pescatore said: "If you're an O2 customer, you'll be able to buy more than just mobile."If you're a Virgin Media customer, the vision - ultimately - will be that you can buy everything in one place with one bill, which isn't the case today."But fellow telecoms analyst Kester Mann, who works at CCS Insight, said customers may need a "new mind-set" if packages for mobile, TV and broadband are to gain popularity."The UK has been a very slow market compared to others in Europe to transition towards this idea of packaged and bundled services," he said. "Customers haven't been demanding these types or services."However, companies like them. "If they can lock customers in to fixed line and mobile then obviously it's that much harder to extract yourself from," Mr Mann said. 
Updated Britain is sleepwalking into another coronavirus blunder by failing to listen to global consensus and expert analysis with the release of the NHS COVID-19 contact-tracking app.On Monday, the UK government explained in depth and in clearly written language how its iOS and Android smartphone application – undergoing trials in the Isle of Wight – will work, and why it is a better solution to the one by Apple and Google that other nations have decided to adopt. It has also released a more technical explanation.Unfortunately for folks in UK, while the explanation is coherent, calm, well-reasoned and plausible, it is likely to be a repeat of the disastrous "herd immunity" approach the government initially backed as a way to explain why it didn't need to go into a national lockdown. That policy was also well-reasoned and well-explained by a small number of very competent doctors and scientists who just happened to be wrong.Here's what's happening: there are broadly two types of coronavirus contact-tracing apps; those that are centralized and those that are decentralized. The first takes data from people's phones and saves it on a central system where experts are trusted to make the best possible use of the data, including providing advice to people as and when necessary.The second, decentralized approach, as set out by Apple and Google, puts users in more control of their information, and alerts them automatically with no intervention from a third party. Apple and Google have also banned apps that use their anonymized API from accessing location services to track and identify people, despite pressure to do so. And they have said they will only allow one app per country, or state in the US, to use the interface.Both types use Bluetooth to detect nearby phones also running the software. Thus, when someone catches the coronavirus, people can be warned if their phone was within 6ft of that patient's phone for more than a few minutes.Leave it to usIn his post, the technical director of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), Dr Ian Levy, explained in persuasive terms why allowing health service experts to have access to all the data collected from the smartphone software is a good idea for beating back the virus."The health authority can use risk modelling to decide which contacts are most at risk, and then notify them to take some action," he noted, adding: "Importantly, the public health authority has anonymous data to help it understand how the disease appears to be spreading, and has the anonymous contact graphs to carry out some analysis."So the health authority could discover that a particular anonymous person seems to infect people really well. While the system wouldn't know who they are, encounters with them could be scored as more risky, and adjust the risk of someone being infected by a particular encounter appropriately."He used two famous epidemiological stories to prove the point: Typhoid Mary and John Snow. Mary Mallon was a cook in New York in the early 1900s who had typhoid fever but showed no signs of it, and ended up infecting a number of households who were otherwise separated from the wider population. No one could figure out why they were falling sick until someone figured out Mary was the link.Likewise John Snow tracked down the source of a cholera outbreak in London in the 1850s down to a water pump in Broadwick Street in Soho and put a stop to it by removing the handle, although later research suggests the outbreak was already dying out by that time. There is, incidentally, a plaque and a pump on the same spot, and the John Snow pub opposite where this reporter whiled away many happy hours.The argument is that while the Apple-Google decentralized model protects people's privacy, it leaves the authorities blind. It puts a public health disaster outside the reach of those who can help most through analysis of the population. Meanwhile, the undertone of the centralized NHS method, where people's data is collected and analyzed together, is almost explicit: we all know how important privacy is but let's leave this to the experts, shall we? Give up a little bit of data and save lives. Let's not go too European on this.So, um, a problem...But there is a concern with the NHS's approach: it requires workarounds to function as advertised, probably won't work as well as expected, and probably won't be terribly accurate at measuring the spread of the virus.Apple's iOS normally forbids applications from broadcasting via Bluetooth when running in the background. That means you would have to leave a contact-tracing app open in the foreground all the time for it to work properly.However, the operating system does allow software, such as the NHS tracing app, to run in a special mode so that it can announce itself to nearby iPhones and iPads via Bluetooth, and listen out for copies of itself on other devices, even when in the background. However, there are strict limits to this.For instance, Apple says the background announcements are designed to work only with other iOS devices, though Android apps could be programmed to work around this. An iOS app's transmissions may be delayed if, for example, the device is busy sending other data over Bluetooth. The app has ten or so seconds at a time to wake up and communicate with nearby phones running the contact-tracing app, or be killed or throttled back.Apple also warns: "Performing many Bluetooth-related tasks require the active use of an iOS device’s onboard radio — and, in turn, radio usage has an adverse effect on an iOS device’s battery life."Meanwhile, Google Android versions 8 and later allow contact-tracing applications to announce themselves for only a few minutes after the app falls into the background. The apps could run as a foreground service on Android all the time, with an icon present to say it's active while other programs run in the foreground, though this isn't particularly battery friendly nor recommended by Google, and could lead to people simply not using the app to preserve power.Thus, compromises have been made to work around iOS and Android, rather than use the decentralized Apple-Google API that has all of this handled automatically in the background by the operating system, which is kinder to battery life and potentially more accurate. Some encounters between people may be missed either due to operating system incompatibilities, limits on execution and transmission, or because the software proves to be such a battery hog that people don't bother with it. Or forget to run the app.For instance, here is a handy video of an iOS contact-tracing app vanishing from a nearby Android phone when the app is closed, or the iPhone falls asleep. This app is Australia's Bluetooth-based COVIDSafe software, which, like the NHS approach, doesn't use the Apple-Google API.The NHS has insisted its engineers have worked around these limits "sufficiently well" by, on iOS at least, running it in the special background mode, and briefly waking the app after it detects itself running on a nearby device. It can also announce itself to nearby iOS devices.Squaring circlesThe other concern with the UK approach is that while it insists it will keep data private, and location data will not be stored nor attached to individuals, the truth is that it will only work as promised if that data is not kept private and location data is stored and attached to individuals.Levy repeatedly tried to square this circle, leading to some ludicrous assertions. He stated boldly in bullet points that the app "doesn't have any personal information about you, it doesn't collect your location and the design works hard to ensure that you can't work out who has become symptomatic" and that "it holds only anonymous data and communicates out to other NHS systems through privacy preserving gateways."But what is literally the first thing the app does when you install and open it? It asks for your postcode, and logs the exact make of your phone.Levy explained "a big random number" is also generated, which is tied to the copy of the contact-tracing app on your phone. This 128-bit ID is what the app on one phone exchanges via Bluetooth with itself on a nearby phone when they come in range. This exchange includes when exactly the IDs were encountered, how long the phones were near each other, and the signal strength, allowing the distance apart to be calculated. This is the data that is ultimately shared with the NHS, when you choose to.The exchanged data is also encrypted in such a way that the NHS can decrypt it but not other users. We understand these ID numbers are generated server-side, and are people's unique fingerprints in the centralized system.Levy also noted that "currently" only "the first part of your postcode" is taken and stored "for NHS resource planning, mainly." He goes on: "Nothing identifying and no personal data are taken from the device or the user."Does it matter?Presumably the goal with this kind of explanation is to comfort the vast majority of UK folk who don't understand how the entire internet economy works by connecting vast databases together.So long as you can rely on one piece of per-user data – like a "big random number" – everything else can be connected. And if you also have a postcode, that becomes 100 times easier. Ever heard of Facebook? It's worth billions solely because it is able to connect the dots between datasets.Indeed, it may be possible to work out who is associating with whom from the app's ID numbers. Bear in mind, the Apple-Google decentralized approach produces new ID numbers for each user each day, thwarting identification, especially with the ban on location tracking.Levy also glossed over the fact that as soon as someone agrees to share their information with UK government – by claiming to feel unwell and hitting a big green button – 28 days of data from the app is given to a central server from where it can never be recovered. That data, featuring all the unique IDs you've encountered in that period and when and how far apart you were, becomes the property of NCSC – as its chief exec Matthew Gould was forced to admit to MPs on Monday. Gould also admitted that the data will not be deleted, UK citizens will not have the right to demand it is deleted, and it can or will be used for "research" in future.And then there's the not insignificant issue that the entire approach may break privacy and human-rights laws, anyway, as one legal firm has advised:A de-centralised smartphone contact tracing system – the type contemplated ... by governments across Europe and also Apple and Google – would be likely to comply with both human rights and data protection laws. In contrast, a centralised smartphone system – which is the current UK Government proposal – is a greater interference with fundamental rights and would require significantly greater justification to be lawful. That justification has not yet been forthcoming.Oh yes, and "the UK Government's announcements for sharing health data between the private and public sector appear to be flawed. This means such data sharing is potentially not in compliance with legal requirements."Just get it outWhat Gould and Levy are not admitting is that they expect the vast majority of UK citizens to opt in, download the app, and share their data anyway, no matter any of these concerns, out of a sense of civic duty.So long as they can get through the objections and push past the criticisms and get the app launched, they will get what they no doubt honestly believe will be a better end result for the country because the data will be in the hands of the experts. And they might – might – be right. But they might also be completely wrong.At the heart of this decision by the UK to fall back on the belief that a central authority is going to be a better solution, no matter what compromises have to be made, is that central planning will work better when it comes to COVID-19.But will it? So far the clear evidence is that greater control of populations has worked better at stopping the coronavirus spread than a more relaxed attitude, The US and UK have notably refused to put limits on their citizens until forced to, and are almost certainly going to end up the worst affected countries on the globe as a result.But does population control work beyond lockdown? When the economy is opened up, will a centralized approach where hotspots can be identified and dealt with from a command post be more effective than a decentralized approach where individuals are left to decide for themselves?We may be about to find out. Although if people can't be persuaded to download the app in the first place because they don't want their data to be floating around the government's servers for the next 100 years, then the whole question is moot anyway. The government is continuing to play a giant game of chicken with our lives. ®  
(CNN)A nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party has dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalates between Washington and Beijing.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday in an interview with ABC that there was "enormous evidence" Covid-19 originated in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December. He did not provide details to support the claim.Responding to Pompeo's comments, China's state owned Global Times newspaper said in an editorial Monday that the former CIA director had "stunned the world with groundless accusations.""Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by 'enormous evidence,' then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool," the editorial said."The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday's interview, he was bluffing."CNN reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment on Pompeo's claims, but received no response. The country is in the middle of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.Scientists around the world have condemned conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin, pointing to studies that suggest it originated in wildlife.China has faced criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the virus, especially during the initial outbreak. It was accused of silencing whistle-blowers and delaying in informing the public about the severity of the crisis.But critics allege Washington has ramped up efforts to blame China for the global spread of the virus as it faces growing criticism at home for its own handling of the pandemic. To date, the US has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and at least 67,000 Covid-19 related deaths.Beijing has hit back with its own propaganda efforts, accusing the US of shifting blame and brushing aside accusations of a deliberate coverup in the critical early stages.Last Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang accused "American politicians" of telling lies about the pandemic."They have only one objective: to try to shirk responsibility for their own epidemic and prevention and control measures and divert public attention," he said.On April 30, China's state-run news agency Xinhua posted an animated video featuring Lego-like figures that mocked the US response to the pandemic. It has been viewed for 1.9 million times on Twitter.On Monday, the Global Times editorial accused the White House of continuing to "engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.""As the US presidential election campaigns are underway, the Trump administration has implemented a strategy designed to divert attention from the incompetence it has displayed in fighting the pandemic. It is clear that their goal is to blame China for the pandemic by pinpointing the country as the source of Covid-19," it said.Origins of the virusThe coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide, with at least 247,000 dead. The US accounts for nearly a third of the global confirmed cases and more than one fourth of the deaths.Pompeo's remarks followed US President Donald Trump's claims on Thursday that he had seen evidence that gave him a "high degree of confidence" the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan. Trump declined to provide details to back up his assertion.Scientists in China and the West have pointed to research indicating that the virus is likely to have originated in bats and jumped to humans from an intermediate host -- just like its cousin that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also said in a statement Thursday that the "Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified."Asked Sunday about that conclusion, Pompeo said he has "no reason to disbelieve" the intelligence community, despite comments earlier in the same interview that "the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point."Chinese officials and state media have repeatedly stressed that there has been no conclusion on the exact origin of the virus, while pushing their own unfounded claims alleging it did not originate in China. In March, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, promoted a conspiracy theory on Twitter that the virus had originated in the US and was brought to China by the US military.The ire of BeijingSo far, Chinese officials and state media have largely avoided directly naming Trump in its coverage of the spat. Instead, much of Beijing's ire has been directed at Pompeo -- and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who does not hold any current position in the administration.Last week, the state-run broadcaster CGTN accused Pompeo of turning "his back on humanity by spreading a political virus." The Chinese Communist Party's official mouthpiece, the People's Daily, also said in an editorial that Pompeo's rhetoric will deliver the US a "colossal moral deficit."On Monday, the Global Times said Pompeo was "indulging in a solo performance that has failed to adhere to the professional standards expected for a chief diplomat," and accused him of losing "his moral compass."State media also bristled at Bannon after he criticized China's handling of the outbreak in an interview with CNBC on Thursday and suggested Beijing should be held financially responsible for the pandemic.On Sunday night, state broadcaster CCTV aired a commentary during its flagship evening newscast that lashed out at Bannon, calling him a "stubborn anti-China figure" with "zero moral integrity."

The head of a global partnership to end tuberculosis (TB) said she is “sickened” by research that revealed millions more people are expected to contract the disease as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.Up to 6.3 million more people are predicted to develop TB between now and 2025 and 1.4 million more people are expected to die as cases go undiagnosed and untreated during lockdown. This will set back global efforts to end TB by five to eight years.“The fact that we’ve rolled back to 2013 figures and we have so many people dying, this for me is sickening,” said Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the Stop TB Partnership. “I am outraged that just by not being able to control what we do … and forgetting about programmes that exist we lose so much, starting with the loss of the lives of people.”There is currently no TB vaccine for adults, only one for children. We look in amazement on a disease that … is 120 days old and it has 100 vaccine candidates in the pipelineLucica Ditiu, Stop TB Partnership“I have to say we look from the TB community in a sort of puzzled way because TB has been around for thousands of years,” Ditiu said. “For 100 years we have had a vaccine and we have two or three potential vaccines in the pipeline. We need around half a billion [people] to get the vaccine by 2027 and we look in amazement on a disease that … is 120 days old and it has 100 vaccine candidates in the pipeline. So I think this world, sorry for my French, is really fucked up,” she said.“The fear we have in the community is that researchers are heading towards just developing a vaccine for Covid. That’s on the agenda of everyone now and very few remain focused on the others [diseases]. We don’t have a vaccine for TB, we don’t have a vaccine for HIV, we don’t have a vaccine for malaria and out of all this, TB is the oldest. So why this reaction? I think because we are a world of idiots. What can I say?” The figures, published on Wednesday, are based on a three-month lockdown and a 10-month period of restoring services after lockdown is lifted.The research was commissioned by the Stop TB Partnership in collaboration with Imperial College London, Avenir Health and Johns Hopkins University. It was modelled on data drawn from rapid assessments of the impact of the coronavirus on TB services in countries with some of the highest number of cases.TB kills 1.5 million people a year, more than any other infectious disease.The past few years have seen a steady decline in cases as a result of more services to treat the disease and prevent its spread.Five years ago, world leaders pledged to end the TB epidemic by 2030. At a high-level meeting in 2018, they promised to scale up their response, including doubling funding by 2022. 
Hall of Fame coach Don Shula died on Tuesday at the age of 90. One of his Hall of Fame pupils took the loss harder than he thought he would.“I was out cutting brush in a field, and my wife Audrey called me and said Coach had passed,” former Dolphins running back Larry Csonka told reporters on Tuesday. “I never really knew until that moment how close that rascal had really got to me, until he was gone. Unfortunately through the course of my life, losing parents and different loved ones, you realize after they’re gone how much more they meant to you than what you realized when they were here. I hope I can be better at that in the future because I felt a terrible loss. I felt like someone very close to me and my family had passed.”Csonka was struck by Shula’s mindset, even if Csonka wasn’t truly a fan of the approach until it produced a perfection season in 1972.“Coach Shula was such a rock,” Shula said. “He was . . . so exact in his feelings, so totally 100 percent, ‘This is the way it is.’ You drew off that strength when you were around him without even realizing it. Sometimes I resented him for it. More often than not, I resented him for it. I muttered with the rest of the players. ‘This is too much, too long, too hot, too everything,’ but the result was perfection. One time. One time in the course of 100 years, one team made every play it had to make during the course of a season to attain perfection. One time. And we were lucky enough to be with that. Now that doesn’t reflect the entirety of his career obviously, but it is a little microcosm of what he was about — that kind of dedication — and once we learned that in ’72, then I never questioned him again.”Csonka wondered aloud where Shula and other former football people go when they pass. Csonka has an idea, one that is bad news for the players and coaches who were already there.“I don’t know where old NFL players go,” Csonka said. “I don’t know – Lombardi, coaches, great players, all the great ones – where are they? Where do they go after they die? Well, I’d like to believe they go to heaven. But I’ll tell you, if they ship the football players off and the coaches off to a certain place, wherever that place is, tonight there is going to be one hell of a lightning bolt hit it because Shula is going to arrive and things are going to change.”Csonka and a teammate once sparked a different kind of lightning bolt with a prank they pulled on their coach.“Manny Fernandez and I decided to go fishing the day after a game — an exhibition game,” Csonka said. “We went out and Manny Fernandez, while we were fishing — Manny was a defensive tackle for us — and he said, ‘Csonk, there’s a gator over on the shore with babies,’ and I said, ‘Yeah, I don’t want any part of it.’ And he said, ‘You know, I can catch one of those,’ and I said, ‘Manny, I don’t think you can catch a baby alligator. You’re going to lose fingers or a leg or the mama’s going to get you. That’s going to be a bad situation.’ He said, ‘No, I’m telling you. I could do it.’“And with that, Manny jumped over out of the boat, went up on the bank, went into the bushes — it was like something in a movie. There was tumbling and screaming and growling and pretty soon Manny Fernandez came walking out of the bushes with a baby alligator about, I don’t know, two-and-a-half, three feet long. [Manny] walked over, threw it in the boat and I jumped out of the boat.“To make a long story short, we took it back to camp. We were going to put it in the pond out front. On the way back to camp, we got the idea that we thought it’d be pretty funny to put it in Shula’s shower. He had a separate shower than the team, devoted to coaches, of course. We thought that would be kind of humorous so we took a vote and [putting it in the shower] won by one vote [and] that we would tape the gator’s mouth shut just in case it got ahold of him in the shower. We didn’t want to lose him entirely. So we taped its nose shut and put it in the shower, and he came out and saw it and came into the locker room and was raising cain and headed straight for me, but I saw him coming so I jumped out the side door and Jim Kiick took the brunt of the abuse for the alligator in the shower.“But the good thing about Shula — the great thing about Shula — was his intensity with anything connected with football, but on a thing like the alligator, he had a great sense of humor, he appreciated that and he had a good laugh about it.”Shula led the Dolphins to a pair of Super Bowl wins, and three straight Super Bowl appearances. The run began in only Shula’s third season with the team, and in only the second after the AFL merged with the NFL.
Union leaders have warned the government’s draft plans to get staff back to work during the coronavirus crisis “have been thrown together in a hurry” and would put people at risk.Staggered shift hours, rearranged offices, and communication over radio are proposed in draft guidelines sent to business groups, major employers and unions.An end to hot-desking, continued home working, and one-way systems in buildings also reportedly form part of proposals revealed days before Boris Johnson unveils the government’s “roadmap” out of lockdown on Sunday.But Britain’s trade union body raised “urgent concerns” about the plans, expected to be finalised in the coming days, which they said contained no requirements on employers to keep people safe at work.The TUC said ministers had made no commitment to increase enforcement to stop companies flouting the law and putting staff in danger.It noted the guidance repeatedly says ”employers should consider” actions such as enabling social distancing or providing handwashing facilities but also suggests individual employers can decide to ignore that advice.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and business secretary Alok Sharma are said to have drawn up seven documents for different industries and settings: hotels and restaurants; work in other people’s homes; factories; working outdoors; working in vehicles; shops; and offices.The guidance, also seen by the BBC and Buzzfeed News, will reportedly urge employers to minimise the number of people using communal equipment, introduce protective screens in some situations, and put additional hygiene rules in place.Shifts and break times could be staggered to reduce crowding at entrances, workers may be told to work facing away from each other, and staff canteens might be told to shut.Office staff will be told to work from home where possible, while “critical” workers who cannot should work further apart, the plans reportedly state.Under the draft proposals, companies with more than five employees will be required to submit a written risk assessment if they wish to reopen during the pandemic.But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said “safe working will not be guaranteed” under the plans as they stand, adding that unions could be expected to support the guidance without any recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment.Prospect union general secretary Mike Clancy added: “We all want to get back to work, but there is no point in easing the lockdown if the guidelines put people at risk, potentially causing a spike in cases and another full-scale lockdown.”John Phillips, acting general secretary of the GMB Union, said the guidance was “thrown together in a hurry and it shows”.“They cannot just flick a switch, say it’s safe to work within two metres of other people without PPE and expect them to head merrily off to work,” he said.He added unions and employers had been given only 12 hours to respond to the draft guidelines which “means crucial changes will not be made”.The criticism came after transport minister Grant Shapps outlined what the easing of the lockdown may look like over the weekend.Mr Shapps said workers who do end up heading back to their jobs may have to travel in at different times throughout the day in order to aid social distancing and give people more room on public transport.“Things like staggering work times [are] very important to avoid those morning peaks. The crushes would be completely at odds with social distancing,” he told Sky News.He also suggested trains, buses and transport interchanges could be equipped with hand sanitiser, and maintained that handwashing remains more important in preventing the spread of the disease than wearing face masks, which some countries have mandated.He also said there is no firm plan yet for when schools can reopen.“It’s no secret that of course we want kids to be able to go back to school, but I’d be over-egging it to say there’s a date in place [and] a plan.”Speaking about the government’s roadmap, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said at the daily news conference in Downing Street on Sunday evening: “We’re consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the prime minister will be saying more later this week.”But he warned the public the end of lockdown would not be like “flicking a switch and going ... back to the old normal”.He said there would be “a phased approach ... which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health”.The NHS will also begin a pilot of its new coronavirus app this week with initial trials for the contact tracing system taking place on the Isle of Wight.But the government has indicated its success depends on a very high uptake among the population. Between 50 to 60 per cent of the entire population will have to use it in order for it to have a real impact. That figure means the app will need to become as ubiquitous as WhatsApp in the space of just a few months.Mr Gove said that “the more people who download the app the better” and was optimistic that people would decide to download it.“It’s striking how publicly spirited people have been throughout the crisis, and knowing that this is a contribution all of us can make to help keep our neighbours and our communities safer is a very powerful incentive, I think,” he said.On Sunday the government said 28,466 people are now known to have died due to coronavirus in the UK – a rise of 315 since Saturday.The figure puts the UK death toll higher than that of Spain, which has the greatest number of known cases of Covid-19 in Europe and just below Italy’s which is currently at 28,884.The UK is on course to become the worst affected country in Europe and the second-worst in the world, in terms of deaths, after the United States where 68,602 people have died. 
With Britain in lockdown, the Government has been racing to find ways to ease restrictions without putting public safety at risk.  One solution is a contact-tracing app that can enable digital contact-tracing on a large scale.The government has revealed of the app, which will be tested on the Isle of Wight and then launched to the rest of the UK in June, if it proves successful. The app went live on the island on May 5.The UK is planning to use trained teams to find people who have coronavirus symptoms, working with the Army to make thousands of calls a day to track the spread of Covid-19, all of which will be complemented by the contact-tracing app.But Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has faced criticism for so far recruiting only 1,500 contact tracers of the Government's 18,000 target by mid-May.And contact tracers are only being hired by the Government for an initial three months - seemingly running contrary to the advice of health experts, who predict the staff will be needed for up to 18 months to assist in controlling the spread of the virus.But what exactly is contract tracing, can it really help lift the lockdown measures, and when will it be available? What is it and how does it work?A contact-tracing app is designed to let people know if they have been in close contact with someone who later reports positive for Covid-19.It could pinpoint exactly who needs to be in quarantine and who doesn’t, making it key to easing up social distancing measures. The purpose of the contact-tracing app is to try and track down people and alert them of the need to self-isolate faster than traditional methods.Users who download the app to their phone can voluntarily opt-in to record details of their symptoms when they start to feel unwell. The app keeps a trace of others who have been in close contact through Bluetooth signals that transmit an anonymous ID. These low energy Bluetooth signals perform a digital "handshake" when two users come into close contact, but keep that data anonymous. If an individual later reports that they are positive for coronavirus, it will then ping a message to people who have been in close-contact with them in the last 28 days based on their anonymous IDs. The app will recommend those people self-isolate in case they have contracted the disease. Those contacted won't know the identity of the person who may have passed on coronavirus.If the person then takes a test and tests negative, they may be released from their self-isolation by a notification through the app.For trials on the Isle of Wight, people who voluntarily report their symptoms will be brought a testing kit within 24 hours, the government has said.The data will not be stored longer than 28 days and the NHSX has said it will be deleted after the app's use is finished and the pandemic is over.The NHS's technology and research arm NHSX has developed the app with researchers from Oxford University and using developers from tech companies like VMWare. It has also been in contact with Apple and Google, although it is using different technology to those technology companies and has rejected their approach.The technology the NHS has built will allow smartphones to track every other device they have come into contact with in the 28 days using Bluetooth signals.Records of contacts will be stored on phones. If a user comes down with coronavirus symptoms they report this in the app. That data is then shared with a health service database and their anonymous ID matched with other phones they have come into contact with.  People who they have been in close contact with will then be sent a notification urging them to isolate.This data will not be linked to people’s names but use anonymous IDs linked to a device, so phone owners will not know who might have passed on the virus. They will, however, be asked to share the first digits of their post code.When will it launch? The app is currently not available widely, but launched on the Isle of Wight on May 5. NHSX chief executive Matthew Gould said the app will be two to three weeks away for the rest of the country. It is now expected to be launched to the rest of the UK in June if the test on the Isle of Wight proves successful.Matthew Hancock, the health secretary, said that people on the Isle of Wight would be written to with details on how to down load the app from the government. He said the slogan for the NHS would be: “Stay at home, install the app,  protect the NHS, and save lives.”Will the app track GPS or need mobile data?The NHS app uses Bluetooth signals to check for contacts. This means it does not need to connect to mobile data when you are out and about. For now the app does not track GPS signals.The NHS said it might introduce a system of monitoring location data in future to collect useful data on the pandemic, but that would be voluntary.Some privacy experts have raised concerns that patient confidentiality risks being compromised.Dr Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, head of the Computational Privacy Group at Imperial College London, has warned that such apps could “collect sensitive information like location data”. “We need to do everything we can to help slow the outbreak. Contact tracing requires handling very sensitive data at scale, and solid and proven techniques exist to help us do it while protecting our fundamental right to privacy. We cannot afford to not use them,” he said. Mr Hancock has pushed back against the privacy concerns, claiming that data would only be held as long as it was needed and that “all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards”.“If you become unwell you can securely tell this new NHS app, and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users who you’ve been in significant contact with,” the health secretary said. Have other countries made something similar?In Singapore, a contact-tracing app called TraceTogether has been rolled out by the government to track those who might be infected by coronavirus.Since March 20 it has been downloaded over 800,000 times in the hopes of creating a “community-driven” response to the virus. What are Apple and Google doing?The two tech giants have teamed up to offer each country a piece of technology that will help turn all iPhones and all Android phones (apart from newer Huawei devices) into contact tracing devices.Apps that use the API (which must be made by a public official) send users “exposure notifications” if they have been in contact with someone who contracted coronavirus. The system records contact as when a smartphone is within a couple of feet of another device for up to 10 minutes. Bluetooth wireless technology can sense devices from up to 15 ft away.Even if people from different countries or states have different contact tracing apps, the system is interoperable and will be able to alert them to exposure. Authorities that want to collect location data of people will not be allowed to use the technology, but are open to building their own. In coming months, they will integrate the technology directly into their operating systems to reach more people. Their tools will be “decentralised” and not send data to central health authorities, but will instead pass it from phone to phone.Google said that the tools would be added to Android via a download in the Google Play store. Apple will offer it via an iOS software update. Apple said the goal is to make it compatible with as many iPhones as possible, including older models.The functionality will only be available to public health apps so outsider developers won’t be able to use that data. It also means that users will have to download an official app to input test results. 
(CNN)A woman is dead after a run-in with an alligator on a South Carolina island, the Charleston County Sheriff's Office said.Deputies responded Friday to a report of an "alligator encounter" with a woman. The incident happened around 5 p.m. at a pond near Salt Cedar Lane on Kiawah Island, the sheriffs office tweeted.A deputy shot and killed the alligator before it was retrieved.The woman killed in the incident was identified by the Charleston County Coroner's Office as Cynthia Covert of Johns Island, South Carolina.Kiawah Island Mayor Craig Weaver called Covert's death "a terrible tragedy.""We live closely with nature on this island. An alligator caused death is exceedingly rare and has not happened on our island before to my knowledge," Weaver said in a statement Sunday. "We know that we must act responsibly and with care around these animals. Consequently, it will be important to know and to share with the community the facts and circumstances from this tragedy, so we can avoid experiencing anything like this again," Weaver said.The Charleston County Sheriff's Office, the Charleston County Coroner's Office, and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources are investigating the incident, Weaver said.CNN reached out to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office for additional information.

New York (CNN Business)J.Crew Group, which operates the J.Crew and Madewell brands, has become the first national US retailer to file for bankruptcy protection since the coronavirus pandemic forced a wave of store closures.The clothing retailer said Monday that it has filed to begin Chapter 11 proceedings in federal bankruptcy court in the Eastern District of Virginia. The company also said it had reached a deal with its lenders to convert about $1.65 billion of debt into equity.The retailer expects to stay in business and emerge from bankruptcy as a profitable company. Madewell, the fast-growing denim brand that had been slated for an IPO, will remain part of the business."We will continue all day-to-day operations," J.Crew Group CEO Jan Singer said in a statement.A bankruptcy filing doesn't necessarily mean a company will go out of business. Many firms use bankruptcy to shed debt and other liabilities they can't afford while closing unprofitable operations and locations.But this is a unique time for a retail bankruptcy. Many stores have been closed by quarantines and stay-at-home orders, and some potential shoppers are nervous about venturing out to any stores that are open.Retailers also frequently use store closing sales to liquidate inventory and raise cash they need to fund operations during a bankruptcy reorganization, said Reshmi Basu, an expert in retail bankruptcies at Debtwire, which tracks the finances of troubled companies.J.Crew's bankruptcy filing is the latest sign of the strain the pandemic has placed on retailers. UBS analysts said last month that "retail store closures are likely to accelerate in a post-COVID-19 world," and that the gap between well-positioned retailers and struggling chains will expand because of the outbreak.The group estimated both assets and liabilities at between $1 billion and $10 billion in its bankruptcy filing.J.Crew got its start as a catalog-only retailer in 1983, before opening its first store in New York City in 1989. The company, which is known for its preppy clothes, was purchased by private equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a $3 billion deal that closed in 2011.It has grown rapidly in the nine years since the deal was closed, nearly doubling the number of stores. But it has also accumulated far more debt. It had $50 million of long-term debt on its books in 2010 before the deal was announced. It had $1.7 billion as of Feb. 1.Numerous retailers that have gone out of business in recent years were first purchased by private equity firms that ladled on an unaffordable amount of debt, including Toys "R" Us, Sports Authority, Payless ShoeSource and Gymboree.J.Crew Group had about 14,500 employees as of a year ago, according to the most recent company filing to disclose a head count. About 10,000 of those employees were part-time.The company operates nearly 500 stores, including J.Crew, Madewell and J.Crew factory stores, but outlets have been closed by health concerns surrounding the coronavirus.The widespread store closings due to the coronavirus were not only a sales setback. They also derailed plans to have an initial public offering of the company's more successful Madewell brand, which would have allowed it to pay down debt.Overall company sales increased 2% last year, to $2.5 billion. But there was a wide split between the success of the two brands, as sales at Madewell locations open for at least a year rose 10% last year, while sales fell 1% at the J.Crew branded stores."Madewell was supposed to be the saving grace. This is an asset that lenders were fighting over for years," said Basu. "But no one wants to do an IPO right now, especially a retail IPO. Covid-19 upturned everything."The company posted a $78.8 million net loss during its most recent fiscal year, an improvement from the $120 million loss the year before. Its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were $250.7 million, more than double the year earlier — $112.8 million — suggesting that the company might have been able to complete its turnaround if plans for a Madewell IPO hadn't been derailed by the virus."As we look to reopen our stores as quickly and safely as possible, this comprehensive financial restructuring should enable our business and brands to thrive for years to come," Singer said on Monday.
iPhone and iPad users will now be able to lock Google Drive. This way, you will not have to sign out of Google’s cloud storage service when handing over your device to someone else. The Privacy Screen feature, which is now available on iOS and iPadOS, would require Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to approve access to Google Drive. The authentication process will take place every time the Google Drive app is opened. However, since it would be a little annoying to authenticate yourself every time you go to Drive, you can set a timer to choose how long it should be before the app is locked. The activation of the lock screen can be delayed for 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes. And, of course, you can choose to keep the feature off if you want. As good as the Privacy Screen feature sounds, it does have some limitations. For instance, you cannot lock specific files or folders, and notifications will still pop up. It also doesn’t apply to certain Siri functionalities.It also doesn't cover the Photos app and the Files app. If you do not have this feature already, you can go to the App Store and update the Google Drive app.

Some Texas businesses, including restaurants, malls and movie theaters, began to reopen Friday in response to Governor Greg Abbott's decision to let the state's stay-at-home order expire. Major theater chains have remained closed, but some smaller theaters have chosen to reopen — with heightened security measures in place. EVO Entertainment CEO Mitchell Roberts told Variety that it plans to reopen two of its theaters with "airport security-style check-in" on Monday. He said the company's "focus is on earning that customer confidence back."The open EVO theaters will allow guests to enter through a cordoned area and will be asked if anyone in their household has had flu symptoms in the last two weeks, Roberts told Variety. Guests will also be subject to an infrared temperature screening, and anyone with a temperature over 100.4 degrees will be turned away.Under an executive order signed by Abbott on April 28, businesses are encouraged to follow the "minimum standard health protocols" recommended by Texas' Health Department, including social distancing. "Individuals are encouraged to wear appropriate face coverings, but no jurisdiction can impose a civil or criminal penalty for failure to wear a face covering," the order reads. Texas theaters are allowed to "operate at up to 25 percent of the total listed occupancy of any individual theater for any screening," according to Abbott's order. If the state sees two weeks of data without any COVID-19 flare-ups, businesses will be allowed to increase that capacity to 50%. New data from Austin research firm Kickstand Communications shows that, while people may return to stores, the same may not be true of movie theaters, CBS Austin reports. According to Kickstand, 15% of Austin residents said they plan to immediately return to shopping at standalone retail stores, and 87% said they'll return within the month. But only 10% said they would immediately return to movie theaters and malls, and just over 60% of Austinites said they are planning to go back within the month.Santikos Entertainment, a movie theater chain based in San Antonio, has reopened three of its nine locations at 25% capacity, Variety reports."We do not take these responsibilities lightly," the company's CEO said in a message posted to its website. "We have been working diligently on safety protocols that will make Santikos a model, not just for theaters, but for all businesses on how to open responsibly."Like EVO, Santikos said it will also ask all customers if they — or anyone they have been in close contact with — has experienced any COVID-19 symptoms within the past 14 days. "If yes, you will not be allowed in the theater and we will reimburse you your ticket," according to the new guidelines. Both companies are offering discounted $5 tickets during the reopening period, spaced seating, and have reconfigured their concessions to reduce person to person contact. "We are confident these daily procedures will provide a safe and enjoyable environment that will allow our community to escape this dreadful reality we've been living in," said Santikos' CEO. As Texas relaxes its regulations, the state has 1,725 people in the hospital due to COVID-19, and 30,522 cases reported, according to the state's Department of Health. Of the 847 deaths reported statewide as of Saturday, 51 were in Austin's Travis County, and 48 in San Antonio's Bexar County. Data suggests the state is doing less than half of its ideal projection of testing 40,000 people a day, despite having over 250 testing sites across the state. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told CBS News' Omar Villafranca that his area needs "about four times as much testing" as they currently have before returning to business."Texas — it fights each day to be either dead last or next to last on the amount of testing," Jenkins said. "To open up, you need to see [the number of cases] go down for two weeks."

Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong had just begun letting its guard down in late February when it was hit by a second wave of the novel coronavirus.After a brief period of low case numbers, new infections spiked dramatically, prompting a series of additional stringent restrictions.That second wave now appears to have largely passed. Hong Kong hasn't had a case of local transmission in more than two weeks, and the city is cautiously resuming normal life.Hong Kong's success in surviving multiple waves of the virus provides hard earned lessons to other cities around the world now looking to relax restrictions.In total, Hong Kong has recorded only 15 new cases since April 20, all of which were people with recent travel history. That brings the city's total to 1,041 cases and four deaths. Of those total cases, 900 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital.The coronavirus first emerged in mainland China in December, and jumped the border into Hong Kong on January 24. By then, it had already made its way to several other countries.Hong Kong closed borders and began social distancing just a week or so after recording its first case. But this three-month stretch of working from home, business closures and service suspensions has dealt a massive blow to both the city's economy and the mental health and wellbeing of residents.Now, with the second wave mostly contained, many are itching to get back to pre-pandemic life."I do feel very strongly, and also echoed by many people in society, that the time for some relaxation, for some lifting of the restrictions that we put on this social contact has come," said the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on Tuesday, shortly before announcing the loosening of some restrictions.The new guidelines, which will go into effect Friday, will allow more people to gather in public and some businesses to reopen.But Lam and other health experts are also cautioning people not to let their guard down too soon, as they did in February. With the virus still wreaking havoc on the rest of the world, it's too soon to celebrate, she warned."I must stress that this epidemic may come back. As the WHO (World Health Organization) said not long ago ... we must remain vigilant," Lam said last week.How Hong Kong contained its second waveIn Hong Kong, public panic peaked in early February, with crowds stockpiling toilet paper, face masks and groceries until supermarket aisles were empty citywide.But the actual number of cases remained relatively low; by the start of March, the city only had about 150 coronavirus cases, despite sharing a border with mainland China where the virus first emerged.Then, as the coronavirus pandemic moved beyond China and hit the West, shuttering universities and raising alarm, Hong Kong students and residents began returning to the city in waves -- bringing the virus back with them. By the end of the month, case numbers had surged past 700.The government took quick, aggressive action to curb the second imported wave; they barred non-residents from entering the city, halted travelers from transiting through the city's airport, and implemented strict quarantine and testing measures on all arrivals to the city, regardless of origin. Those under home quarantine were given electronic bracelets to track their location.The government implemented restrictions like prohibiting alcohol sales in bars and closing all gyms and sports facilities. Many restaurants and cafes closed; those that stayed open had to cut down seating capacity to increase the distance between customers, or put up physical barriers between tables.Though many of these measures were viewed by some as drastic, authorities never ordered an official lockdown or stay-at-home order, relying instead on community efforts and peoples' compliance to contain the virus.This approach appears to have worked, with new daily cases dropping once again. April 19 was the last recorded local transmission.Cautious return to normal lifeThe government and the public are now cautiously turning their focus to resuming life and business in the city, and transitioning from survival to healing."I think right now the immediate priority is definitely to revive the economy because after all, we have been subject to many restrictions on all you can imagine in the past few months due to Covid-19," said Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, on May 2.On Monday, the government reopened recreational and sports spaces like tennis courts, resumed some services like drivers' license tests and classes, and resumed community services for vulnerable populations like the disabled and elderly.Starting Friday, the number of people permitted to gather in public will be raised from four to eight. Some businesses like fitness centers, beauty salons, massage parlors and bars will be allowed to reopen, albeit with restrictions like a cap on customers.Schools will also gradually reopen from May 27, with students returning to classrooms in batches and staggered phases.The public has wholeheartedly embraced this loosening of restrictions as summer arrives. The past two weekends have seen beaches, hiking trails, and campgrounds packed with people. Restaurants are filling up again, with nightly lines out the door for some, and others booked up for the next few weeks. It's been a long, draining three months of pandemic -- and people are eager to let loose.But medical experts in the city are warning residents not to relax completely yet. It's too soon to say local transmissions have entirely stopped, said Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan of the Centre for Health Protection on Monday.Since the virus' incubation period is up to 14 days, authorities would need to see two full incubation periods -- 28 days -- without infections to declare an end to local transmissions, Chuang said.And there's another concern looming on the horizon now -- the return of social unrest. The city was rocked by six months of often violent pro-democracy anti-government protests in 2019, which came to a halt during the pandemic. Now, there are signs that as the danger of coronavirus subsides, protesters are gearing up to return to the streets.There have already been a handful of small-scale protests in the past two weeks -- and authorities, too, are getting ready for potential clashes."Hong Kong has consecutively seen zero cases of the coronavirus," posted Lam on Facebook last week. "At the moment we are able to withstand the pandemic ... Hong Kong was able to withstand the harsh winter, but I worry Hong Kong may be unable to withstand the resurgence of violence of the continuous devastation caused by politics." 
Britain has only met two of the Government's five key tests that must be passed before the coronavirus lockdown can be lifted, a top advisor admitted today.The deputy chief medical officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said there remained 'challenges' to be overcome before the tick list could be completed.His announcement came just days before the lockdown is due to be reviewed, and Boris Johnson pushed back the timing of his exit plan by days.Speaking at the daily Downing Street news conference Prof Van-Tamm said that the first two tests, making sure the NHS is not overwhelmed and a sustained fall in deaths, had been achieved.Britain's daily coronavirus death toll today rose by 288 - the lowest 24-hour jump since the end of March, as figures show the UK's crisis is continuing to slow down after peaking in mid-April.But the news on the final three was less reassuring.He said: 'The next one is solid information that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. This is an indicator that we need to keep a close eye on  over the next few days and weeks.'The fourth one is around operational challenges around testing and PPE and being able to meet future demand. 'There are continuing challenges on PPE. It's an absolute priority to keep pushing on this, to get it right in the long-run. But of course on testing .... we are in a very good position.'On the fifth, being confident the NHS can withstand a second peak of cases, he added: 'This is really a matter of deep scientific discussion - very, very close following and absorbing of the evidence and one that we are keeping under detailed scientific review as the days and the weeks go by.'His analysis came as Nicola Sturgeon today dismissed the prospect of any 'meaningful' change to lockdown this week. The Scottish First Minister declared at a briefing in Edinburgh that the situation is so delicate the curbs cannot be significantly eased.She also promised to set out her own proposals for how to ease the curbs tomorrow - nearly a week before the PM is expected to unveil his strategy. The latest brazen example of Ms Sturgeon gazumping the Westminster government came amid signs the two-metre social distancing rules could be softened to help revive the economy.The shape of the 'road map' has started to emerge, with a leaked draft suggesting it will recognise that keeping gaps between workers is not always possible.Instead companies will be advised they can take other precautions such as installing screens and imposing strict hygiene procedures.Meanwhile, offices will be told to overhaul their rotas to minimise risks by staggering arrival, break and departure times, ending hot desking and avoiding sharing equipment.Ministers confirmed this morning that the government has started stockpiling face masks for public use.   The PM is expected to unveil the exit strategy in an address to the nation on Sunday, having delayed the announcement by three days as frantic work continues in Whitehall. The law requires that a decision on extending the lockdown measures be taken by Thursday, but ministers could have initial results from a huge surveillance project to assess the prevalence of the disease by the end of the week. In a video posted on the Downing Street Twitter feed today, Mr Johnson warned that the 'worst thing' the country could do right now is 'ease up too soon' while there is still a threat of a 'second peak'.  'We will only be able to move onto the second phase of this conflict if our five tests have been met,' he said.The tests are: that the NHS must have sufficient critical care capacity; there must be a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths; the infection rate must be decreasing to 'manageable levels'; there must be enough PPE and testing supply; and any adjustments must not lead to a second peak which could overwhelm the health service.Mr Johnson said: 'The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus.' Ministers have been under massive pressure to set out the way forward, with the draconian current curbs estimated to be costing the country £2billion a day.The obstacles have been underlined with unions threatening to block plans to get rail services up to 85 per cent of usual levels within a fortnight. Furious Tory MPs accused the RMT of trying to exploit the situation to get more money for their members. Downing Street stressed that current guidance was for people to maintain the two metres gap 'where possible'.  In other developments in the coronavirus crisis At her daily briefing in Edinburgh today, Ms Sturgeon said that, although 'real and significant progress' was being made, the rate of reproduction of the virus was still too high to alleviate lockdown measures.She said it is 'likely' that lockdown measures will continue without any 'meaningful' changes.'Although we are making real and significant progress ... the numbers still eing infected by the virus and the all-importnat R number remain too high right now to make any meaningful change without risking the virus running out of control again,' she said.  Saying she expected to unveil her own exit plan tomorrow, Ms Sturgeon said work would be done to ensure there was alignment with the rest of the UK, but divergence in measures could still be possible. The First Minister also outlined the Scottish Government's test, trace, isolate (TTI) strategy, which she said would aid the easing of the lockdown measures.Ms Sturgeon said the strategy would only work if the public adheres to it, adding it was not a 'quick fix or magic solution' and would need to be done alongside current hygiene guidance.Ms Sturgeon said moves were being made to deliver a TTI strategy by the end of May, with testing capacity expected to have to rise to 15,500 per day to support the approach.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace hinted that social distancing advice will be fleshed out, telling Sky News that that protective screens and ensuring people were not close together for very long could reduce the need for strict distancing. 'You can look at shielding, you can look at how long you stay near people. The two-metre rule reduces the possibility of infection by a certain amount of time,' he said.'If you halve that it still keeps people away from being infected but for a lesser time. The probability of being infected is much less.'I think there are options about how we can do it. You can wear PPE, that could be a possibility if you have to be in close proximity or indeed you could find other ways of doing it.'He pointed towards supermarket workers working behind 'shields'. Mr Wallace also confirmed that the government is stockpiling face masks in case it decides to change its advice - something that has already happened in Scotland. Mr Johnson has said they will be 'useful' in the next phase of lockdown but the Westminster guidance has not been updated, 'It's not the amazing thing if you wear a mask that no one's going to get it but there is obviously this issue about human nature and interactions if you go on public transport and wear a mask will you feel able to go back to work,' Mr Wallace said.'At the same time, to anticipate should different rules be made around masks we're trying to source as many masks as possible as we speak and have been for the last few weeks.'Sir Jeremy Farrar, a SAGE member and head of the Wellcome Trust, said there was 'nothing magical' about the two metre advice, and it was based on long-standing evidence about how far coughs and sneezes were likely to travel.'There is nothing magical about two metres,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Perhaps more importantly is the time you spend near someone else.'  The draft guidance, a version of which has been leaked to the BBC and Financial Times.It suggested vulnerable staff - such as those aged over 70, pregnant, with underlying health conditions or pregnant - should be put in the 'safest possible roles'.The guidance is clear that anyone who can work from home should continue to do so - meaning many staff will be out of the office for months to come.  But the draft does not spell out what action should be taken on PPE - saying merely that more information will follow. Some businesses fear they might be open to legal action from staff if they loosen the rules without clear direction from the government. Mr Wallace played down concerns that 'coronaphobia' could hamper efforts to get the economy running again, with polls showing significant numbers would be nervous about returning to work.The Defence Secretary said: 'I strongly believe the public aren't stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media.'They took on board the Government's advice... and I think they will be perfectly able to read the Government's next stage when we get to it.'I'm totally confident when it comes to the next step we will all together be able to move forward.' Mr Johnson will describe the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as the 'most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes' later as he calls on nations to 'pull together' in response to the pandemic.The Prime Minister is expected to tell an online pledging conference - co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations - that the sooner states share their expertise the faster scientists will succeed in defeating the disease.It comes as Mr Johnson revealed he feared he would not live to see his baby son Wilfred born when he battled Covid-19 in intensive care last month.The PM will tell the conference, which aims to bring in more than £6.6billion in funding, that the race to develop a vaccine is 'not a competition between countries but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes'.'It's humanity against the virus - we are in this together and together we will prevail,' he is expected to say.Coronavirus has claimed more than 246,000 lives around the world, according to analysis by John Hopkins University.A total of 28,446 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday. Meanwhile, the government is facing fresh pressure over testing, after the daily number slumped to 76,496 - below the 100,000 target. Cabinet minister Michael Gove told the daily Downing Street press conference last night: 'Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine then I suspect that we are going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.'But we obviously want to, wherever possible, and consistent with the measures on public health, restore people's lives to as close to normal as possible.'He said the Government will pursue a 'phased approach' to removing lockdown restrictions rather than a sudden return to 'the old normal' - and that the easing had to be done in a 'cautious fashion'.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson faces a backbench rebellion over his Government's 'absurd, dystopian and tyrannical' coronavirus lockdown today.Furious Tory MPs including 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady and ex-Brexit ministers David Davis and Steve Baker are preparing to voice anger over the extent of the enforced shut-down. They will argue that the economic, social and health costs of the self-imposed paralysis of UK PLC is so great that it must be eased. They will use a debate on the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations brought in in March, which gave ministers and police the greatest swathe of restrictive powers ever granted in peacetime.As well as measures to unclog the stagnant economy there are civil liberties concerns about the new NHS contact tracing app and the way it tracks the public.Mr Johnson is expected to announce measures to allow the lockdown to be eased in an address to the nation on Sunday, after it is officially extended for three more weeks on Thursday.But Mr Baker, a former Brexit 'Spartan' who is no stranger to going contrary to his front bench, said 'whatever the necessities, that the rule of law should have been overthrown in this period is extraordinary and deeply troubling,' in an article for the Daily Telegraph.'Millions of people in our country have been plunged into idleness at public expense and unemployment, facing financial and psychological hardship on a scale never seen before,' he added.''Thousands of people have missed life-prolonging health appointments. Vulnerable people are isolated and domestic violence has soared. Soon will come the full economic impact on all our lives.'He went on: 'This is absurd, dystopian and tyrannical. The sooner it is ended, the better.' Mr Johnson today warned that lifting lockdown restrictions too soon would be 'the worst thing we could do'.In a video message on Twitter, the Prime Minister said it was important to meet the five tests set by the Government before easing the lockdown. Mr Davis, who has a long history of speaking out on civil liberties issues, is preparing to challenge the Government over its new contact tracing app, which is due to start trials on the Isle of Wight this week.

Now that the Bears have done the expected and declined the quarterback’s fifth-year option for 2021, the 2017 No. 2 overall pick is on the clock.        Mitch Trubisky can be Kevin White or Kyle Fuller.Now that the Bears have done the expected and declined his fifth-year option for 2021, the 2017 No. 2 overall pick is on the clock.He has a year to fight for his place with the organization.That begins with winning the starting job. The Bears say he’ll take the first snap of the first practice — whenever that may be — but their offseason moves showed how little faith they have in him. They traded a fourth-round pick for Nick Foles, giving him at least $21 million over three years, because they think he’ll be needed.Whether Trubisky wins the job will chart his course toward White or Fuller.        The Bears’ declining of White’s fifth-year option two years ago was their most obvious move of the decade. In three years, the No. 7 pick of the 2015 draft had only 21 catches for 193 yards.The Bears signed Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel in March 2018. A month later, they traded up to draft Anthony Miller in the second round. They didn’t need White anymore and weren’t going to count on him to produce. White was a healthy scratch in seven games in 2018. He caught four balls for 92 yards — but one was a 54-yard Hail Mary that fell a yard short of the goal line against the Patriots. He left after the 2018 season and hasn’t played a regular-season snap since.        Three years ago, general manager Ryan Pace decided to decline Fuller’s fifth-year option. Former GM Phil Emery’s last first-round pick had missed all of the previous season after having arthroscopic knee surgery in August. Pace signed veteran Marcus Cooper to a three-year, $16 million deal, not willing to rely on Fuller to take the next step.Fuller began 2017 as the starter because of Prince Amukamara’s injury, then started for Cooper when he hurt his back before Week 5. Fuller never looked back.“He has helped resurrect his career,” defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said then.Fuller was so valuable by the end of 2017 that the Bears issued him the transition tag, which would have paid him $12.97 million in 2018. He wound up making even more when the Packers signed him to a four-year, $56 million offer that the Bears quickly matched.If Trubisky plays as well in 2020 as Fuller did in 2017, the Bears could use a similar mechanism to keep him in place. The 2021 franchise tag will cost at least $3 million more than the $24.8 million the Bears would have otherwise owed Trubisky — but the team would likely be thrilled to pay it. Presuming, of course, that the Bears don’t need to use it on Robinson, whose contract extension has yet to materialize this offseason.Only one top-five pick from 2017 — No. 1 overall selection Myles Garrett — had his option picked up. But Trubisky is the only one in the group compared to the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes and the Texans’ Deshaun Watson, who will soon negotiate contracts to override their fifth-year options. Still, a world exists — if the Bears have the appetite to run the ball and tight ends to catch it — in which Trubisky could be a competent starter.In that sense, he’s probably closer to ex-Bear Leonard Floyd, a 2016 first-round pick, than White or Fuller. Trubisky and Floyd have otherworldly athleticism for their positions, but it hasn’t translated on Sundays.The Bears picked up Floyd’s option last year but cut him before he could play his fifth season after watching him get only three sacks.The Bears decided Floyd simply wasn’t good enough.Trubisky’s bosses have pointed him down the same path. He has a year to change their minds.
KERN COUNTY, Calif. (FOX26) — Kern County's stay-at-home order is now lifted. However, the area still falls under the State's shelter-in-place order, which overrides the local ruling.This comes as Kern County closes in on 1000 coronavirus cases.The Kern County County Health Officer said Saturday the local order was meant to serve as a show of support for the statewide order.Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday that he was "days, not weeks" away from adjusting the statewide order.Kern County says its decision to lift its order is in anticipation of the transition to a re-opened economy."We want the county to be positioned so we can quickly maximize our local response and clear the way for the changes ahead," Kern County Public Health explained.The Kern County Board of Supervisors has also created an ad-hoc committee that will review and interpret the statewide list of essential businesses, then make recommendations for how the County should proceed in opening and operating those businesses.The County Health Department explained, this is all in an effort to expedite the re-opening process."We continue to ask the community to adhere to the Governor’s order to stay at home and practice social distancing. These actions have been determined to have a significant impact on flattening our curve and helping slow the spread of COVID-19."As of Saturday, April 2nd, there were 962 confirmed coronavirus cases in Kern County. 8 people there have died.579 people in Kern County have recovered from the coronavirus.
Some producers acknowledge the efforts are “just a drop in the bucket” of what farmers can’t sell and are destroying instead.While millions of Americans are worried about having enough to eat and lines at food banks grow, farmers have been plowing under vegetable fields, dumping milk and smashing eggs that cannot be sold because the coronavirus pandemic has shut down restaurants, hotels and schools.Now, the destruction of fresh food on such a scale has prompted action by the Trump administration and state governments, as well as grass-roots efforts like a group of college students who are renting trucks to rescue unsold onions and eggs from farms. But they most likely won’t be enough to address the problem if businesses remain closed for months.Over the next few weeks, the Department of Agriculture will begin spending $300 million a month to buy surplus vegetables, fruit, milk and meat from distributors and ship them to food banks. The federal grants will also subsidize boxing up the purchases and transporting them to charitable groups — tasks that farmers have said they cannot afford, giving them few options other than to destroy the food.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office has said New York will give food banks $25 million to buy products made from excess milk on farms in the state; the state is working with manufacturers like Chobani, Hood and Cabot to turn the milk into cheese, yogurt and butter. Some of the state subsidy can also be used to buy apples, potatoes and other produce that farms have in storage.Nationally, the Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States, has diverted almost a quarter of a million gallons of milk to food banks.“It’s just a drop in the bucket,” said Jackie Klippenstein, a senior vice president at the co-op. “But we had to do something.”The closure of restaurants, hotels and school cafeterias wiped out huge sources of demand for fresh food, leaving farmers with millions of pounds of excess. While increased sales at grocery stores have made up for some of that, not since the Great Depression has so much fresh food been destroyed. (In the 1930s, the problem was that people could not afford to buy all the crops farmers were producing, which led the federal government to establish an early food stamp program.)The Agriculture Department grants are expected to be announced this week, but farmers say their losses far exceed what the grants can provide.“These are not insolvable problems,” said Marion Nestle, a food studies professor at New York University. “These are problems that require a lot of people, sums of money and some thought. If the government were really interested in making sure that hungry people got fed and farmers were supported, they would figure out a way to do it.”There are some signs that the waste is starting to dissipate. At the beginning of April, farmers were dumping 3.7 million gallons of milk each day, draining it into manure pits, where it mixed with fertilizer used in the fields. Now, the waste is closer to 1.5 million gallons, according to the dairy co-op, as farmers scale back production and restaurant chains like Papa John’s heed the industry’s call to add extra cheese to every pizza.Even as the waste declines for some food, other farmers are scrambling to find new buyers. California strawberry growers, for example, are reaching peak harvest season in May.“Time is not on our side," said Mary Coppola, a vice president at the United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group of fruit and vegetable growers and processors. “In my own personal opinion, we are not coming up with the supply-chain logistical solutions as quickly as produce is growing.”Some people, upset by all the food waste when families are running low, are trying to come up with other solutions.A group of university students have started an online site, FarmLink, seeking to connect farmers with food banks. James Kanoff at Stanford and Aidan Reilly at Brown founded the group last month with donations from family and friends.So far, it has diverted 50,000 onions that were about to be destroyed on a farm in Oregon and paid for their transportation to Los Angeles, where they were distributed to food banks. The students also bought 10,000 eggs from a California farm, rented a truck and drove them to a large food bank.FarmLink, which now includes about 20 students from several colleges, has been cold-calling hundreds of farms to find surpluses.“Just getting through to the farmers is the hardest part, because they are so busy,” said Jordan Hartzell, a Brown student.The need at food banks is only increasing as the economic crisis intensifies. There are still long lines outside many food banks, as the charities struggle with a surge in need and a scarcity of volunteers because of stay-at-home orders.While the details are being worked out, the New York subsidy may allow dairy companies like Chobani to drive trucks of their products into neighborhoods with the most need and hand them out in a public park.At the small food pantry she runs in Casper, Wyo., Mary Ann Budenske has seen shortages of staples like milk and eggs. On Thursday, a shipment of about 200 gallons of milk that arrived at 2:30 p.m. was half gone by 5. She has sent more than 20 emails to farmers and trade associations, offering to drive her 1998 Ford pickup truck to retrieve the leftover food herself.“Pretty much I’m getting the bureaucratic ‘We’re looking into that — we’ll get back in touch with you,’” Ms. Budenske said. “The whole thing makes me sick.”
(CNN)A Florida sheriff appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis after the Parkland school shooting is defending himself after admitting he fatally shot a man when he was 14 years old.Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said in a statement Monday he "shot an armed man in self-defense" during his time growing up in a Philadelphia neighborhood "filled with violence and gang activity."News of Tony's involvement in the 1993 shooting came to light when the online news organization Florida Bulldog reported the incident on Saturday after interviewing the family of 18-year-old Hector "Chino" Rodriguez, the man he killed."This was the most difficult and painful experience of my life and I have never spoken of it publicly. I worked every day from that time forward to leave the violence that surrounded me in Philadelphia behind," Tony said in his statement to CNN."Surviving this assault inspired me to do work to help others. The world is filled with violent individuals and brave men and women who protect the innocent against their actions. This is the essence of law enforcement and is why I have dedicated my life to service in law enforcement."Tony was initially charged as an adult, but his case was transferred to juvenile court, where a judge found him not guilty and sealed his records, the Florida Bulldog reported.Tony eventually left Philadelphia and moved to Florida to play football at Florida State University, where he graduated with a degree in criminology.His career in law enforcement began when he joined the Coral Springs Police Department SWAT team in 2005.Tony did not mention the shooting when he applied to become a law enforcement officer in Coral Springs or when DeSantis appointed him as sheriff, according to the Florida Bulldog.Tony told the Tampa Bay Times he has no regrets about not disclosing the shooting because he was never arrested."Under Pennsylvania law, they looked at this thing and found no just cause for any type of crime," he added.After the Pennsylvania juvenile justice system reviewed the incident, it was "concluded there was no crime and cleared (Tony's) name," a spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriff's Office told CNN.Becoming the Broward County sheriffDeSantis appointed Tony to replace Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who the governor suspended for failing "in his duties to keep our families and children safe" during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 14 students and three teachers dead.Tony, who was appointed in January 2019, became the first black sheriff in Broward County's history."It's not like he's my sheriff. I didn't even know the guy. It's not like he was a political ally of mine," DeSantis said during a press conference Monday,"The people I talked to in Broward have been pleased with what he's doing. That's ultimately a decision that the people in Broward can make. It's not going to be anything I'm going to be getting involved in."A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told CNN before his appointment as sheriff, they completed a level 1 background check on Tony.The agency included a court query with their request and found no court records in Pennsylvania. The FDLE also conducted a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check and found no sealed records.When asked if Tony was obligated to disclose his involvement in the shooting, the spokesperson said they could not answer that question.The governor said one of the reasons he appointed Tony was because he liked that the sheriff "had come from real tough upbringing" and was a great officer.Tony is running against Israel in a heated race for the 2020 election of the next Broward sheriff. Both candidates have received no-confidence votes from their deputies. 
Among the most important unanswered questions about Covid-19 is this: What role do children play in keeping the pandemic going?Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do have mild symptoms, if any. But do they pass the virus on to adults and continue the chain of transmission?The answer is key to deciding whether and when to reopen schools, a step that President Trump urged states to consider before the summer.Two new studies offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. Neither proved it, but the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said.Many other countries, including Israel, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have all either reopened schools or are considering doing so in the next few weeks.In some of those countries, the rate of community transmission is low enough to take the risk. But in others, including the United States, reopening schools may nudge the epidemic’s reproduction number — the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case, commonly referred to as R0 — to dangerous levels, epidemiologists warned after reviewing the results from the new studies.In one study, published last week in the journal Science, a team analyzed data from two cities in China — Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, and Shanghai — and found that children were about a third as susceptible to coronavirus infection as adults were. But when schools were open, they found, children had about three times as many contacts as adults, and three times as many opportunities to become infected, essentially evening out their risk.Based on their data, the researchers estimated that closing schools is not enough on its own to stop an outbreak, but it can reduce the surge by about 40 to 60 percent and slow the epidemic’s course.“My simulation shows that yes, if you reopen the schools, you’ll see a big increase in the reproduction number, which is exactly what you don’t want,” said Marco Ajelli, a mathematical epidemiologist who did the work while at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The second study, by a group of German researchers, was more straightforward. The team tested children and adults and found that children who test positive harbor just as much virus as adults do — sometimes more — and so, presumably, are just as infectious.“Are any of these studies definitive? The answer is ‘No, of course not,’” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in either study. But, he said, “to open schools because of some uninvestigated notion that children aren’t really involved in this, that would be a very foolish thing.”The German study was led by Christian Drosten, a virologist who has ascended to something like celebrity status in recent months for his candid and clear commentary on the pandemic. Dr. Drosten leads a large virology lab in Berlin that has tested about 60,000 people for the coronavirus. Consistent with other studies, he and his colleagues found many more infected adults than children.The team also analyzed a group of 47 infected children between ages 1 and 11. Fifteen of them had an underlying condition or were hospitalized, but the remaining were mostly free of symptoms. The children who were asymptomatic had viral loads that were just as high or higher than the symptomatic children or adults.“In this cloud of children, there are these few children that have a virus concentration that is sky-high,” Dr. Drosten said.He noted that there is a significant body of work suggesting that a person’s viral load tracks closely with their infectiousness. “So I’m a bit reluctant to happily recommend to politicians that we can now reopen day cares and schools.”Dr. Drosten said he posted his study on his lab’s website ahead of its peer review because of the ongoing discussion about schools in Germany.Many statisticians contacted him via Twitter suggesting one or another more sophisticated analysis. His team applied the suggestions, Dr. Drosten said, and even invited one of the statisticians to collaborate.“But the message of the paper is really unchanged by any type of more sophisticated statistical analysis,” he said. For the United States to even consider reopening schools, he said, “I think it’s way too early.”In the China study, the researchers created a contact matrix of 636 people in Wuhan and 557 people in Shanghai. They called each of these people and asked them to recall everyone they’d had contact with the day before the call.They defined a contact as either an in-person conversation involving three or more words or physical touch such as a handshake, and asked for the age of each contact as well as the relationship to the survey participant.Comparing the lockdown with a baseline survey from Shanghai in 2018, they found that the number of contacts during the lockdown decreased by about a factor of seven in Wuhan and eight in Shanghai.“There was a huge decrease in the number of contacts,” Dr. Ajelli said. “In both of those places, that explains why the epidemic came under control.”The researchers also had access to a rich data set from Hunan province’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials in the province traced 7,000 contacts of 137 confirmed cases, observed them over 14 days and tested them for coronavirus infection. They had information not just for people who became ill, but for those who became infected and remained asymptomatic, and for anyone who remained virus-free.Data from hospitals or from households tend to focus only on people who are symptomatic or severely ill, Dr. Ajelli noted. “This kind of data is better.”The researchers stratified the data from these contacts by age and found that children between the ages of 0 and 14 years are about a third less susceptible to coronavirus infection than those ages 15 to 64, and adults 65 or older are more susceptible by about 50 percent.They also estimated that closing schools can lower the reproduction number — again, the estimate of the number of infections tied to a single case — by about 0.3; an epidemic starts to grow exponentially once this metric tops 1.In many parts of the United States, the number is already hovering around 0.8, Dr. Ajelli said. “If you’re so close to the threshold, an addition of 0.3 can be devastating.”However, some other experts noted that keeping schools closed indefinitely is not just impractical, but may do lasting harm to children.Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the decision to reopen schools cannot be made based solely on trying to prevent transmission.“I think we have to take a holistic view of the impact of school closures on kids and our families,” Dr. Nuzzo said. “I do worry at some point, the accumulated harms from the measures may exceed the harm to the kids from the virus.”E-learning approaches may temporarily provide children with a routine, “but any parent will tell you it’s not really learning,” she said. Children are known to backslide during the summer months, and adding several more months to that might permanently hurt them, and particularly those who are already struggling.Children also need the social aspects of school, and for some children, home may not even be a safe place, she said.“I’m not saying we need to absolutely rip off the Band-aid and reopen schools tomorrow,” she said, “but we have to consider these other endpoints.”Dr. Nuzzo also pointed to a study in the Netherlands, conducted by the Dutch government, which concluded that “patients under 20 years play a much smaller role in the spread than adults and the elderly.”But other experts said that study was not well designed because it looked at household transmission. Unless the scientists deliberately tested everyone, they would have noticed and tested only more severe infections — which tend to be among adults, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.“Assumptions that children are not involved in the epidemiology, because they do not have severe illness, are exactly the kind of assumption that you really, really need to question in the face of a pandemic,” Dr. Hanage said. “Because if it’s wrong, it has really pretty disastrous consequences.”A new study by the National Institutes of Health may help provide more information to guide decisions in the United States. The project, called Heros, will follow 6,000 people from 2,000 families and collect information on which children get infected with the virus and whether they pass it on to other family members.The experts all agreed on one thing: that governments should hold active discussions on what reopening schools looks like. Students could be scheduled to come to school on different days to reduce the number of people in the building at one time, for example; desks could be placed six feet apart; and schools could avoid having students gather in large groups.Teachers with underlying health conditions or of advanced age should be allowed to opt out and given alternative jobs outside the classroom, if possible, Dr. Nuzzo said, and children with underlying conditions should continue to learn from home.The leaders of the two new studies, Dr. Drosten and Dr. Ajelli, were both more circumspect, saying their role is merely to provide the data that governments can use to make policies.“I’m somehow the bringer of the bad news but I can’t change the news,” Dr. Drosten said. “It’s in the data.”

A WIDE-ranging post-Brexit trade deal with the US has the power to accelerate the UK's recovery from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Federation of Small Businesses has predicted, with almost half of all small firms seeing America as the most important trading partner.Mike Cherry, FSB chairman, said he was hoping small businesses would be placed at the centre of any future deal, given the crucial importance of US markets.He said: "For small businesses, the US is the number one single market of choice for importers and exporters for the next three years, which is why these negotiations are so critical.“Exporting will be crucial for many small businesses to support their recovery from the pandemic and that is why it’s crucial to see a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers."The coronavirus pandemic is costing UK businesses an estimated £2.5 billion a day, with uncertainty about what the future holds, Mr Cherry acknowledged.However, he added: "With our economy likely to be suppressed for some time, we are going to need small businesses that trade to lead the way."The prospects of a trade-led recovery would be lifted by progress in trade negotiations with the EU as our nearest trading bloc, the US as the largest global economy, as well as other nations already bouncing back after COVID-19 such as China."However, he singled out the US as key, saying: "Our own findings suggest that the US is the most important individual country market for small firms hoping to export over the next three years, with 46 percent selecting the country.“Small businesses are already the backbone of the UK’s domestic economy."And especially in these difficult times, we now need to see their share of global trade start to catch up."We can do this by putting SMEs front and centre of all new trade agreements.“Securing a pro-small business free trade agreement, which includes a comprehensive and dedicated small business chapter, will be essential to addressing the needs and distinct challenges that small firms face when engaged in transatlantic trade."Mr Lighthizer acknowledged the impact of COVID-19, and the importance of the ongoing discussions, on Tuesday, saying: "While this is at first a health crisis, each of us is also facing an economic crisis perhaps like never before."But we need to prepare now for the day when the health crisis recedes and lay the foundations for stronger, more resilient economies."This crisis has demonstrated how important it is to have strong and diverse supply chains with trusted trade partners to support our economies."It has shown that we need to have a healthy manufacturing base and workers and farmers that are thriving."It has shown that depending purely on cheap imports for strategic products can make us vulnerable in times of crisis."Moreover, it has confirmed that we need to think carefully about our trade policies and how we work with our trading partners."Ms Truss said: “The US is our largest trading partner and increasing transatlantic trade can help our economies bounce back from the economic challenge posed by coronavirus.“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.“As the Prime Minister has said, the UK is a champion of free trade and this deal will make it even easier to do business with our friends across the pond.”

North Korea fired gunshots at a South Korean guard post in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a buffer area which separates the two countries, on Sunday, and the South fired back, according to its military.The North Korean gunfire hit the wall but did not injure anyone or cause any discernible damage to the guard post or its equipment, said South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Several bullets from the North were fired into the DMZ at 7:41 a.m. local time Sunday, the JCS said in a text message to press.The South Korean military responded by broadcasting a verbal warning and returning fire twice, according to protocol outlined in the response manual and on the judgment of the field commander, according to the JCS statement. The South Korean military said that "the military is in the process of identifying situations over the military communication line with the North and preventing any additional situations from occurring."US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that initial reports indicated the gunfire from the North was "accidental.""I've seen that reporting too. I've seen some of our internal information as well. We can confirm at least the initial reports are that you've described are just about right. A handful of shots that came across from the North. We think those were accidental. South Koreans did return fire so far as we can tell there was no loss of life on either side," Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."Under the military accord signed between the two Koreas on September 29, 2018, the South and North each demolished 11 guard posts along the DMZ, but dozens of guard posts remain. There have been exchanges of fire between the Koreas in the past, including in 2017, when a North Korean solider defected at the JSA (Joint Security Area) and, in 2014, when a North Korean defector organization launched balloons of leaflets criticizing the country's reclusive regime.Pompeo was tight-lipped regarding North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who had not been seen publicly for weeks before images were shown Friday on state television of him at a fertilizer factory. During that period, Kim had missed an annual event held on April 15 honoring his grandfather."We don't know why he chose to miss that moment. We know there have been other extended periods of time where Chairman Kim's been out of public view as well so it's not unprecedented. ...We've seen the same images from yesterday that the world saw, looks like Chairman Kim is alive and well," Pompeo said."Regardless of any of that, our mission remains the same -- to convince the North Koreans to give up their nuclear weapons, to verify the same and to then create a brighter future for the North Korean people."Asked whether Kim was seriously ill during this period, Pompeo said: "I just can't say anything about that." He also refused to say whether the US had any information about whether Kim's situation was connected to Covid-19 or a heart issue.As recently as this past week, the US was monitoring intelligence suggesting Kim was in grave danger following a surgical procedure. National security adviser Robert O'Brien acknowledged the US was watching the situation closely on April 21.

A key model of the coronavirus pandemic favored by the White House nearly doubled its prediction Monday for how many people will die from the virus in the U.S. by August – primarily because states are reopening too soon.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine is now projecting 134,000 coronavirus-related fatalities, up from a previous prediction of 72,000. Factoring in the scientists’ margin of error, the new prediction ranges from 95,000 to 243,000.Dr. Christopher Murray, the director of IHME, told reporters on a call Monday the primary reason for the increase is many states’ “premature relaxation of social distancing.”For the first time, Murray explained, the model is factoring in data from four different cell phone providers showing a major uptick in Americans’ going out in public.This rise of mobility in the last week or 10 days is likely leading to an increase in transmission, he said.Monday’s update is the fourth since the model debuted in late March. It’s been relied on by the White House in recent months because it presents a more optimistic forecast on health system capacity, cases and deaths than other experts have predicted.Even with its latest forecast, the University of Washington model is still far more optimistic than a model developed by Johns Hopkins for CDC predicting as many as 3,000 deaths per day by June. Murray said that model, which the New York Times published Monday, is likely inaccurate.“Our numbers are nowhere near that level,” he said, noting that IHME is forecasting 890 deaths per day by June 1. “This relates very much to whether the models think there is going to be a large, New York-style epidemic in some states. We don’t see that because we’re building into the modeling the rising temperatures and rising testing and contact tracing. That will put the brakes on transmission enough that we won’t see 3,000 deaths a day by June 1.”In a statement on Monday evening, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health called the leaked models “preliminary analyses,“ saying that they had been provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help in scenario planning, were not a final version and were not meant to be used or presented as forecasts.Still, the statement added, “the information illustrates that there are some scenarios, including the premature relaxation of social distancing, that are likely to cause significant increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States.“The White House on Monday acknowledged the existence of the internal administration document but asserted that the grim modeling had not gone through interagency vetting and “is not reflective” of any projections from or analyzed by the White House coronavirus task force.In a statement to reporters, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said that the internal report obtained by The New York Times was “not a White House document” and hadn’t been presented to the coronavirus task force.The CDC document projects north of 175,000 new cases of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, each day. That’s up from about 25,000 new cases per day last week and more than four times the peak of about 37,000 new cases per day.The alarming modeling comes as some states are already beginning to put parts of the White House’s phased reopening plan into motion despite concerns that the administration’s guidelines for doing so have not yet been met. It also underscores fears that moving too fast to relax strict social-distancing restrictions could fuel a dangerous second wave of infections.The CDC document found some reason for optimism, noting that nationwide, the trajectory of new illnesses in "multiple counties, including hard hit areas in Louisiana and in the New York City region" has continued to decrease, and that incidence rates have recently plateaued around Chicago.Still, it found that there "remains a large number of counties whose burden [of illness] continues to grow or are in an elevated incidence plateau, including in the Great Lakes region, parts of the Southeast, Northeast, and around southern California." The document includes a color-coded map of the country with darker spots peppered throughout, and it states that the goal "is to have all communities be represented in the lighter colors, demonstrating little to no disease burden and no increase in trajectory."Deere on Monday defended the White House plan, which President Donald Trump released last month with the goal of returning to some semblance of normalcy and reviving an economy that has been shuttered over the past two months due to the virus.The guidelines “are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with,” Deere said. “The health of the American people remains President Trump's top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions.”Murray also noted that the updated University of Washington model also now takes into account the ramping up of testing in most states, as well as warming temperatures heading into late spring and early summer. But he cautioned that the impact of temperature on coronavirus transmission is not yet fully understood, and likely will not be for several more months.For now, IHME is assuming that every degree Celsius the temperature goes up will lead to a 2 percent decline in transmission.“Are we sure about that? No,” he said.
An invasion of Asian giant hornets became the latest 2020 worry — and internet sensation — as the term "murder hornet" began to trend over the weekend.The first spotting of the 2-inch Asian giant hornet, or vespa mandarinia, was verified in the United States in December, according to the Washington state Agriculture Department. The insect does not generally target people or pets, but it is a deadly threat to at-risk honeybee hives.Giant hornets of this species apparently enter a "slaughter phase" during which they decapitate honeybees and destroy entire hives in the span of a few hours, according to the department.Although the species was first spotted months ago, the term "murder hornet" circulated on Twitter over the weekend after a New York Times report Saturday on efforts to stop the species from annihilating honeybees.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsAs the globe reels with the upheaval of normal life during the coronavirus pandemic, the internet latched onto "murder hornets" as yet another strange development of 2020.Recommended"Murder hornets. Sure thing, 2020," actor and comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted Saturday. "Give us everything. Hypno-frogs. Fecal blizzards. Toilet tsunamis. A CATS sequel. We can take it."An invasion could have severely negative impacts on the environment and public health, the Washington Agriculture Department warned.The species has longer stingers with more toxic venom that could pose a danger to people if the insects feel threatened. And unlike honeybees, the Asian giant hornets can sting repeatedly, entomologist Chris Looney said in a video posted to the department's YouTube page last month.Authorities are working to find nests and destroy them before they can reproduce, according to Looney.Looney warned people against trying to kill the hornets themselves and to avoid their nests entirely. Instead, the public is encouraged to report a possible sighting to local authorities.

Britain’s small businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to access loans of up to £50,000 from today – with the cash expected to land within days.mall businesses will be able to apply for quick and easy-to-access loans from todaybusinesses will be able to borrow between £2,000 and £50,000 with the cash arriving within daysloans will be 100% government backed for lenders, and businesses can apply online through a short and simple formThousands of small firms and sole traders – including high street staples like hairdressers, coffee shops and florists – will be eligible for 100% government-backed Bounce Back Loans to help them make it through the coronavirus outbreak.From 9am this morning, small business owners can apply to accredited lenders by filling out a simple online form, with only seven questions.The government has also agreed with lenders that an affordable flat rate of 2.5% interest will be charged on these loans. And any business that has already taken out a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan of £50,000 or less can apply to have these switched over to this generous new scheme.The Bounce Back Loan scheme is the latest step in a package of world-leading support measures launched by Chancellor Rishi Sunak – with £7.5 billion already awarded in business grants, 4 million jobs supported through the job retention scheme and generous tax deferrals supporting hundreds of thousands of firms. To apply, see further information about the Bounce Back Loan scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said:Small businesses will play a key role creating jobs and securing economic growth as we recover from the Coronavirus pandemic.The Bounce Back loan scheme will make sure they get the finance they need - helping them bounce back and protect jobs.Business Secretary Alok Sharma said:We are backing small businesses, which are the backbone of our communities, with the support they need to stay afloat.This new scheme of 100% government-guaranteed loans gives owners of even the smallest businesses the confidence and flexibility to borrow a sum which works for them. This will help ensure they can continue to trade, and be a key part of our efforts to reboot the British economy.As part of the scheme, small businesses can borrow between £2,000 and £50,000. The government will provide lenders with a 100% guarantee and cover the cost of any fees and interest for the borrower for the first 12 months. No repayments will be due during this period to enable firms to get back on their feet.The loans are available through a network of lenders, including the five largest banks.Further InformationEligible companies will be subject to standard customer fraud, anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks prior to any loan being made. Some State Aid restrictions may apply to applications.The borrower always remains 100% liable for the debt.Government support for business of all sizes:Reactions from business groups:Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:“We know many small firms have struggled to secure small loans speedily. We are pleased that the Chancellor has listened, and swiftly developed this new scheme for small businesses to access finance quickly, interest-free for the first year and at an affordable fixed interest rate for the remainder.”Tej Parekh, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors (IOD) said:“The government has kept an open ear to businesses, and continues to adapt its coronavirus response, which is very welcome. The business interruption loan scheme has started to reach firms, but small firms were still having difficulty accessing finance. This additional measure should help more of those firms get the cash they need to see them through the weeks and months ahead.”Stephen Jones, CEO, UK Finance said:The Bounce Back Loans Scheme will help smaller businesses and sole traders rapidly access the finance they need by filling in a simple form online with an accredited lender.This builds upon the broad package of support that lenders are already offering to help SMEs through these tough times, including capital repayment holidays, extended overdrafts and billions of pounds worth of lending.Accredited lenders approved to offer Bounce Back Loans have worked at pace with the Treasury to get this scheme up and running by Monday, and staff are now focused on processing applications and getting money to businesses as quickly as possible.Rob Hattrell, Vice President of eBay UK said:This is extremely welcome news for small businesses up and down the country who trade online and offline, including the 300,000 who trade on eBay on a daily basis. Many of Britain’s SMBs are really struggling financially in the current crisis. Hopefully, this move from government will help our very smallest businesses get the financing they need quickly to manage their cash flow or replenish their stock.While the existing CBIL scheme may be appropriate for some businesses, our smallest businesses told us that they were finding it hard in practice to access this support from banks. By extending the current government guarantee from 80% of each loan to 100%, we hope this will make it more likely that banks will extend finance at a critical time. And by making it simpler to apply, SMBs should be able to get the help they need quickly just when they need it most.Dr. Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said:“The launch of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme is an important milestone in getting credit flowing to small firms who have so far struggled to access the financial support they need. The standardisation of the interest rate that can be charged after the first 12 months is a welcome step in helping firms manage their ongoing costs. > “We look forward to working with the government, British Business Bank and UK financial institutions to ensure that the new scheme supplies cash to businesses on the ground quickly.”Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, said:The Chancellor is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with small businesses to help them through the crisis.A 100% government guarantee on loans and a simple way of applying will be a lifeline to many small businesses and sole traders under pressure.Banks have been operating at full throttle and must stay in overdrive to get more money out of the door faster. Time is of the essence. 
Australia and New Zealand are planning a "travel bubble", or corridor, that will allow the quarantine-free flow of people between the two neighbours.Both countries have severely restricted international travel to prevent the spread of coronavirus.However, if successful, the "bubble" could grow to include more countries that have a low number of cases.A wider scheme is planned with Canada and other Asian economies to help supply chains and business travel.The governments of Australia and New Zealand revealed their plans on Tuesday to set up a "trans-Tasman travel bubble", although no timeframe was given.This quarantine-free travel zone could provide huge advantages to both nations, who have shown strong records for containing the virus. Currently, they impose a 14-day quarantine on international arrivals.New Zealand PM: No open borders for 'a long time'How NZ beat the virus and got its coffee backAustralia eyes early lifting of virus restrictions"The broader reality is the global travel market is in a very bad way. In our part of the world and around the trans-Tasman route it makes clear sense that a travel bubble can work in our neck of the woods," said Simon Westaway, executive director at the Australian Tourism Industry Council.Qantas, Australia's biggest airline, wants to start using the travel bubble once domestic flights across Australia are resumed."It's a positive we weren't expecting up till now and hopefully it can be established as a model to open part by part the international network when various countries have a control on Covid-19," said the airline's chief executive, Alan Joyce.According to Mr Joyce, New Zealand is the second-largest source of tourists heading into Australia, while Australia is the largest source of tourists for New Zealand.He said it would give people in Australia a destination "that they're comfortable flying to", and vice versa.Mr Joyce hopes the travel bubble can be extended to more countries if successful."If the New Zealand bubble idea gets traction and that we're comfortable with that and that seems like it's working well, then a similar approach could be done with markets where countries have Covid-19 under control."Chris Roberts, chief executive of New Zealand's tourist board Tourism Industry Aotearoa, said it needed the correct health safeguards and the best use of technology to work."If New Zealand and Australia can show this can work, then it is likely to be adopted elsewhere. It could be 12-18 months before we return to open borders." Mr Roberts hopes the travel bubble will include its Pacific Island neighbours as they are heavily dependent on tourism. After that "New Zealand would likely look to places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and South Korea which are doing well in the fight against Covid-19 as the next places to re-establish links with".Australia and New Zealand are also involved in a larger "trade bubble" looking to agree guidelines for essential business travel. The wider group includes Canada, South Korea and Singapore.The group's aim is to resume the flow of goods, services and key people. The plan includes "guidelines to allow, on an exceptional basis, essential cross-border travel for purposes such as maintaining global supply chains, including essential business travel," according to a joint statement.The countries also want a fast-tracking customs procedure on essential items such as food and medical supplies, and to restart logistics networks across air, sea and land freight.

Nicolás Maduro, the embattled leader of Venezuela, said Monday that authorities in Caracas captured 13 “terrorists” – including two U.S. citizens – in a failed invasion attempt that he said was no doubt orchestrated by the Trump administration.In a nationwide broadcast appearance on state television, Maduro held up two U.S. passports that he said had been recovered during the attempted raid. He read off the names and birthdays of the two Americans.“They were playing Rambo,” he said, according to The Guardian. “They were playing hero.”The two U.S. citizens were identified as Luke Denman and Airan Berry, both former U.S. special forces soldiers. Video emerged that purported to show Venezuelan authorities with their captives lined up at a seaside marina.Maduro said the U.S. government is “fully and completely involved in this defeated raid," The Associated Press reported. He praised citizens from a fishing community for cornering one of the groups he described as “professional American mercenaries.”The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials and Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, denied any involvement with the action called “Operation Gideon.”The Guardian reported that Guaidó’s team denied any connection to Florida-based ex-Green Beret Jordan Goudreau who said earlier Monday that his mission intended to detain Maduro and “liberate” Venezuela. Goudreau has claimed responsibility for the operation. The AP reported earlier that Goudreau was working with a retired Venezuelan army general facing U.S. narcotics charges along with other defectors. The report said the makeshift army of about 60 lacked U.S. support.Venezuela and the United States broke diplomatic ties last year amid heightened tensions, so there is no U.S. embassy in Caracas.Goudreau said earlier Monday that he was working with the two men who served in Iraq and Afghanistan with him in the U.S. military. He told The Washington Post that he has been in touch with a lawyer in Venezuela and has been reaching out to the State Department. He called on the U.S. to retrieve the captured men.“They are Americans,” he said. “They are ex-Green Berets. Come on."Kay Denman, the mother of one of the Americans, told the AP the last time she heard from her son was a few weeks ago, when he texted her from an undisclosed location to ask how she was coping with the coronavirus pandemic. She said she never heard her son discuss Venezuela and only learned of his possible capture there after his friends called when they saw the reports on social media.“The first time I heard Jordan Goudreau’s name was today,” she said when reached at her home in Austin, Texas.  
Samsung doesn’t release more than two major Android OS updates for its devices and doesn’t really keep flagship devices on the monthly release schedule for security updates beyond three years. That’s just the way it is and there’s no indication of this changing any time soon.With the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ now crossing that threshold, it’s no surprise that the company has shifted both of these devices to the quarterly cycle. That means both of these devices will no longer receive monthly security updates.No more monthly security updates for the Galaxy S8/S8+Samsung had been sending out monthly security updates for these handsets up till now, releasing one just last month which brought the April 2020 security patch. Given that the Galaxy S8/S8+ hit shelves on April 21, 2017, it has been a full three years since these devices were released.It was about time that Samsung shifted them from the monthly update cycle to the quarterly cycle, and it has done just that now. What does being on the quarterly schedule mean exactly? Samsung will simply bundle all of the security updates in one firmware update that’s going to be sent out once every quarter.There was obviously no question of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ getting the Android 10 update. They have received the two major OS updates that they were entitled to. Going forward, these devices will only receive one update per quarter. No new features have been added to the devices for quite some time now anyway, so there’s no use expecting that the next update will bring anything other than the security patch.The Galaxy S8 Active is still on the monthly update cycle. It arrived in August 2017 so it still has a ways to go before hitting the three-year threshold after which it will also be relegated to the quarterly cycle.

After years of complaints over sticky or unresponsive keys, Apple has finally finished transitioning its notebook lineup away from its issue-prone butterfly keyboard.With the new 13-inch MacBook Pro featuring the same scissor switch Magic Keyboard as the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple no longer sells any new MacBook Pro or MacBook Air models with a butterfly keyboard. If you are browsing Apple's refurbished store, however, be aware that many of those models are still equipped with the butterfly keyboard.First introduced on the 16-inch MacBook Pro last year, the Magic Keyboard features a redesigned scissor mechanism with 1mm of key travel, an inverted-"T" arrangement for the arrow keys, and a physical Escape key next to the Touch Bar.Models with more reliable Magic Keyboard:2019 16-inch MacBook Pro2020 13-inch MacBook Pro2020 MacBook AirApple's butterfly keyboard suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or nonfunctional keys. The company continues to offer free repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program, and it even apologized over the matter last year, although it downplayed the issue and said that only a "small number" of customers were impacted. 
In a brilliant dance, a cornucopia of flowers, pinecones and acorns connected by wind, rain, insects and animals ensure the reproductive future of seed plants. But before plants achieved these elaborate specializations for sex, they went through millions of years of evolution. Now, researchers have captured a glimpse of that evolutionary process with the discovery of a new ancient plant species.The fossilized specimen likely belongs to the herbaceous barinophytes, an unusual extinct group of plants that may be related to clubmosses, and is one of the most comprehensive examples of a seemingly intermediate stage of plant reproductive biology. The new species, which is about 400 million years old and from the Early Devonian period, produced a spectrum of spore sizes -- a precursor to the specialized strategies of land plants that span the world's habitats. The research was published in Current Biology May 4."Usually when we see heterosporous plants appear in the fossil record, they just sort of pop into existence," said the study's senior author, Andrew Leslie, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). "We think this may be kind of a snapshot of this very rarely witnessed transition period in evolutionary history where you see high variation amongst spores in the reproductive structure."A major shiftOne of the most important time periods for the evolution of land plants, the Devonian witnessed diversification from small mosses to towering complex forests. The development of different spore sizes, or heterospory, represents a major modification to control reproduction -- a feature that later evolved into small and large versions of these reproductive units."Think of all the different types of sexual systems that are in flowers -- all of that is predicated on having separate small spores, or pollen, and big spores, which are inside the seeds," Leslie said. "With two discrete size classes, it's a more efficient way of packaging resources because the big spores can't move as easily as the little ones, but can better nourish offspring."The earliest plants, from between 475 million to 400 million years ago, lacked reproductive specialization in the sense that they made the same types of spores, which would then grow into little plantlets that actually transferred reproductive cells. By partitioning reproductive resources, plants assumed more control over reproduction, according to the researchers.The new species, together with the previously described plant group Chaleuria of the same age, represents the first evidence of more advanced reproductive biology in land plants. The next example doesn't appear in the fossil record until about 20 million years later."These kinds of fossils help us locate when and how exactly plants achieved that kind of partitioning of their reproductive resources," Leslie said. "The very end of that evolutionary history of specialization is something like a flower."A fortuitous findThe researchers began analyses of the fossils after they had been stored in the collections at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for decades. From about 30 small chips of rock originally excavated from the Campbellton Formation of New Brunswick in Canada by late paleobotanist and study co-author Francis Hueber, they identified more than 80 reproductive structures, or sporangia. The spores themselves range from about 70 to 200 microns in diameter -- about a strand to two strands of hair. While some of the structures contained exclusively large or small spores, others held only intermediate-sized spores and others held the entire range of spore sizes -- possibly with some producing sperm and others eggs."It's rare to get this many sporangia with well-preserved spores that you can measure," Leslie said. "We just kind of got lucky in how they were preserved."Fossil and modern heterosporous plants primarily live in wetland environments, such as floodplains and swamps, where fertilization of large spores is most effective. The ancient species, which will be formally described in a follow-up paper, has a medley of spores that is not like anything living today, Leslie said."The overarching story in land plant reproduction is one of increased division of labor and specialization and complexity, but that has to begin somewhere -- and it began with simply producing small spores and big spores," Leslie said. "With these kinds of fossils, we can identify some ways the plants were able to do that."Co-authors of the study are from Brown University, the University of North Carolina -- Chapel Hill and the University of Sheffield.Story Source:Materials provided by Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences.

Men with advanced prostate cancer can take highly targeted hormone therapies at home instead of coming into hospital for chemotherapy, NHS England says.Experts say it will relieve pressure on the NHS, which wants all urgent and essential cancer treatments to continue during the coronavirus pandemic.The drugs are also smarter, kinder treatments and could extend the lives of many more patients, they say.This precision-medicine approach is already used to treat other cancers.'Huge shock'Diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in February, Stuart Fraser, 66, from Ashtead, in Surrey, will now take four enzalutamide tablets a day."Being diagnosed was a huge shock," he said."What made it even more worrying was that, because of coronavirus, I was told I couldn't have the usual treatment of chemotherapy, which would have affected my immune system."When I heard about other possible treatments like abiraterone and enzalutamide, I launched a petition to try to make sure men like me could get hold of it."That's why it's such great news that now no-one will be in the same position I was at the beginning of all this."Enzalutamide blocks the effect of the testosterone hormone on prostate-cancer cells, preventing them from growing.Patients intolerant to enzalutamide, will be given abiraterone, which stops the body producing testosterone.Until now, in England and Wales, the drugs were available only to patients for whom other hormone therapy had stopped working, although abiraterone was recommended in Scotland as a first-line treatment earlier this year.Now, doctors can prescribe them when a patient is first diagnosed.'Hard-pressed hospitals'Prof Nick James, of the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, who has led major trials into targeted prostate cancer drugs, said: "I'm pleased and relieved that many more men should now benefit from targeted hormone therapies right from when they are first diagnosed."It will greatly lower the risk of exposing vulnerable patients to the coronavirus and lightens the load on our hard-pressed hospitals."Men can take their tablets at home and have their bloods checked by their GP."And, unlike chemotherapy, enzalutamide and abiraterone have no significant effects on patients' immune system."National clinical director for cancer Prof Peter Johnson said: "The NHS has been working hard to ensure the safety of cancer patients during the pandemic."Switching from chemotherapy to hormone treatments for prostate cancer is just one example of how we are adapting our approach to help thousands of cancer patients across the country continue to access the care they need."

Call of Duty's free-to-play battle royale game, Warzone, is performing incredibly well right now, and Activision is apparently going to continue to support the game even after the next mainline Call of Duty game comes out later this year. In a new interview, Infinity Ward's Taylor Kurosaki teased that Warzone will be the "throughline that connects all the various sub-franchises of Call of Duty."Reading between the lines here, it sounds like Warzone will continue to be supported with content based on the year's new Call of Duty game."We're in kind of uncharted territories here," Kurosaki told GamerGen. "Call of Duty has been on a very regular cadence for many many years, and Warzone has made us rethink exactly how best to release new content and how to integrate it. Call of Duty is a genre in itself, there are different branches in the Call of Duty tree, but they're all connected in some ways. Warzone will be the throughline that connects all of the different various sub-franchises of Call of Duty."Kurosaki further teased that he's excited to see how the various other Call of Duty games get incorporated into Warzone as the years go on."It's going to be really cool to see how the different sub-franchises sort of come in and out of focus, but Warzone will be the one constant," he said.Activision has a track record of supporting multiple CoD games at once. Black Ops 4, for instance, continues to receive new events, although the majority of new CoD content is focused on Modern Warfare, Warzone, and CoD Mobile.2020's new Call of Duty game is reportedly a Cold War/Vietnam-era Black Ops spin-off from Treyarch with the support of Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software. It is expected that it will be a cross-generation title, releasing for PS4, Xbox One, and PC, as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X.Warzone is Call of Duty's second battle royale experience, following the Blackout mode that was featured in 2018's Black Ops 4. The situation is different, however, as Blackout is only available to people who bought Black Ops 4, while Warzone is a free-to-play standalone game.

Twitter has started testing a new threaded conversation layout that’s meant to make it more obvious who’s talking to whom. Based on the GIF posted by the Twitter Support account, the new layout makes use of lines and indentations to clearly indicate that a reply is meant for a specific tweet. As TechCrunch notes, it looks particularly useful for longer threads where participants go back-and-forth and where people post responses to several separate tweets. The platform has been experimenting with this layout over the past year on its prototype app twttr, TC says, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong posted a demo on her account in early April. Wong’s demo shows that clicking on a tweet in the threaded layout expands it and gives you an easy way to post a response to it.Twitter been playing with different types of layouts for quite a while now, including putting labels on conversation threads. Just this February, it rolled out a threaded layout similar to this one for iOS users. Since this is just a public experiment, the new feature is only making its way to some users on iOS and the web and will only become widely available if the company decides it’s good enough to ship to everyone.
President Trump twice received intelligence briefings on the coronavirus in January, according to a White House official. The official tells NPR the briefings occurred on Jan. 23 and Jan. 28.    "The president was told that the coronavirus was potentially going to 'spread globally,' " the official said of the first briefing, which came two days after the first case of the virus was reported in the United States. "But the 'good news' was that it was not deadly for most people," the official said the president was told.    Five days after that initial briefing, the president was briefed again, according to the official. This time, he was told the virus "was spreading outside of China, but that deaths from the disease were happening only in China," the official said. "He was also told that China was withholding data."   The question of what Trump knew about the coronavirus, when he was aware of it and the tenor of those conversations have come under heavy scrutiny, as the administration faces criticism that it was slow to respond to early warnings about the virus. In the time since the president's January briefings, the U.S. has reported more than 1.1 million cases of the coronavirus — more than any other nation. In all, more than 66,000 Americans have died.               The president has defended his handling of the crisis — pointing to steps like his decision at the end of January to restrict travel into the U.S. from China. But for much of the following month, the president and some of his top surrogates downplayed the threat of the virus.   "We pretty much shut it down coming in from China," the president said in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News early in February. By the end of the month, with the virus reported in several dozen countries at that point, he continued to tell reporters that the risk "remains very low."   During his State of the Union address, roughly a week after being told that China was withholding data, Trump said his administration was "coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak."   To this point, the White House has offered little clarity publicly about the exact dates when Trump was briefed about the virus. Asked about this on Thursday, Trump told reporters that he spoke with intelligence officials about the coronavirus "in January, later January," adding that intelligence officials had confirmed that this was the case.    On Monday, when The Washington Post reported that Trump received more than a dozen classified briefings in January and February, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence responded, "The detail of this is not true," and declined to elaborate.

We’ve all heard them — the blaring alerts that activate our cellphones or television when a severe weather warning is issued.Perhaps our favorite weather app sent us a push notification, or we saw a television meteorologist pointing at vibrant boxes on a weather map. Whatever the medium, weather warnings have a way of finding us, especially whenever a severe thunderstorm is close by. Now those warnings, specifically the way in which they’re generated, are in the process of getting a makeover.Severe weather warnings are issued for individual thunderstorms; before 2007, entire counties would be alerted at once. Over the years, weather warnings have become more targeted — but one warning can still cover an expansive area. Moreover, conditions can vary wildly even within the region enclosed by a single warning.The National Weather Service is hoping to change that.Kodi Berry leads the program that’s updating warnings at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. The Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats program, or FACETs, is an endeavor the National Weather Service is pursuing to communicate the hazards posed by severe thunderstorms on a hyperlocal level.Berry says the goal is provide a more continuous flow of information for those who need it the most.More precise warningsAccording to the National Severe Storms Laboratory, FACETs aims to improve weather watches and warnings to provide “detailed hazard information through the use of ‘threat grids’ that are monitored and adjusted as new information becomes available.”Typical weather warnings are issued in the form of polygons digitally drawn on a map. If you’re within the polygon, you’re alerted and urged to take action — such as seeking shelter. But just a stone’s throw away, a neighboring home outside the polygon may not be given any special instructions. The state of weather warnings is binary, akin to a “yes” or “no” to severe weather.Berry’s team is hoping to improve that by creating a product that reflects the gray area in between. They are experimenting with displaying probabilities to reflect the range of possible outcomes in a rapidly evolving severe weather event.“There has been a lot of social science research that shows that, given probabilistic information, people make better decisions,” Berry said. “If we appropriately define these probabilities and what they mean, people can use them to make better decisions.”Imagine you work in a nursing home 20 miles downwind of a tornado-producing thunderstorm. An existing tornado warning extends only 15 miles downstream, so you’re not under a warning — yet.But you know it takes half an hour or more to move all the residents to shelter. Do you start now? Or do you wait until a warning is (or is not) issued?Berry’s team found the one-size-fits-all binary nature of warnings doesn’t necessarily fit all consumers. “Some people may need a little more time than what the warning provides,” Berry said. “They may have a lower personal probability threshold.”A probabilistic approachAdding probabilities will not replace existing weather warnings but rather offer more context for people around the warning itself. The probabilities will be assigned on a gridded map, much like most weather forecasts, and will update by the minute in real time.Probabilities will be greatest along the center of the storm’s predicted path, diminishing radially outward as well as farther downwind. Berry’s office compares the so-called plume to the probabilistic wind speed graphics issued by the National Hurricane Center.Severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings themselves are getting an overhaul, too. Warnings will now “move” with storms, growing downwind if a storm looks to hold together. The back edge of the warning will “drop out” behind the storm, too — akin to an “all clear” message once the danger has passed.“I think the most beneficial thing is the more equitable lead time,” Berry said. “[In the past], people near the downstream edge of the warning [got] much less lead time if they [weren’t] weather aware.”The warnings themselves will also be updated more frequently. “I think the National Weather Service policy [currently] is that a tornado warning should be updated … once every 15 minutes,” explained Berry. “We’ve tested one-minute updates, two-minute updates. … We started to notice a big difference when we got to the five or two minute [intervals].”Streamlining the processAll this updating could dramatically heighten a forecaster’s workload, particularly in environments with multiple storms occurring simultaneously. That’s where automation comes in.“[Meteorologists] are getting some automated guidance that isn’t solely radar,” Berry said. While details are hazy as to what this computer software guidance might look like, it would likely ingest data from surface observations, satellite products, lightning mapping arrays and more.That means some severe weather warning updates could theoretically be entirely computer-generated. But that doesn’t mean anything is being left on autopilot.“There’s a lot of forecaster value that I don’t think can be replaced by automation,” Berry said. “One of the features that we included [in an online interface] was to be able to graphically tell which ones were automated versus which ones had been touched by the forecaster."The shape of the warning could also be changed by automated software packages based on severe weather probabilities churned out by high-resolution computer models. Berry’s team is working on a proposal regarding best practices to prevent fluctuations in the forecast to result in an “expanding and contracting [warning] with time.”“You don’t want people going in or out of the warning,” Berry said. “We’re working to create more consistency with the warning.”Berry estimates these changes could take up to five years to implement. By then, atmospheric scientists are hoping to overhaul their strategy for issuing weather warnings — making calls based on forecasts, rather than detection.Warn on forecastIn the current system, a severe thunderstorm warning isn’t issued until a storm meets severe thunderstorm criteria — the capability of producing damaging wind or hail larger than the size of quarters. The same is true with tornado warnings — rotation must be spotted within a storm.With more advanced high-resolution computer models, NOAA aims to model individual thunderstorms before they become severe or generate a tornado, issuing warnings based on the forecast of severe weather. Such modeling would test the limits of current forecasting, since they would have to detect weather features at local scales many current models miss.There may even come a day when you’ll get a severe thunderstorm or tornado warning while standing beneath a blue sky — awaiting a storm that has yet to develop. 
Michael Jordan's Air Jordan sneaker series is probably the most iconic shoe line in history. Since their release in 1984, Nike has released a new edition nearly every year. The shoes have long transcended basketball, leaving an indelible impact on the fashion and music world. Nike was able to ink Jordan to a five-year deal worth $500,000 per year, with the opportunity to earn more in stock options and other bonuses.Were it up to a 21-year-old Jordan in 1984, however, he never would have signed with Nike. His preferred choice? One of Nike's main rival companies: Adidas."Do you have a shoe company that you wanted to go with?" Jordan is asked during episode five of The Last Dance documentary. "That was Adidas," he replies.In archival footage from Jordan before his NBA career began, Jordan is seen saying "I like the Lakers, I like Marques Johnson, and I like Adidas. I like Adidas shoes.”During this segment of the episode, Adidas is portrayed as being disorganized, and unable to support the creation of a signature basketball shoe at the time Jordan was entering the league."Adidas was really dysfunctional by that time," says Jordan's agent, David Falk. "And they had just told me, ‘Look, we’d love to have Jordan, we just can’t make a shoe work at this point in time.’ I wanted Michael to go with Nike because they were the big upstart."At the time, Jordan was so dead-set on signing with Adidas, he told Falk, "I have no interest in going (with Nike). Just do what you need to do to get me with Adidas,” according to ESPN's Darren Rovell.In hindsight, no price would have been too exorbitant for Adidas to offer Jordan in 1984. Nearly three decades later, Air Jordans are still considered royalty among sneakerheads everywhere. Had Jordan gotten his wish and signed with Adidas, who knows how different the basketball shoe landscape would look today.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democrat from Michigan, said in an interview Sunday that she knows Joe Biden and the sexual assault allegation leveled against him is not “consistent with” the person she knows.Whitmer, who is reportedly on a shortlist of potential vice president picks for the former Delaware senator, joined other Democrats like Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, who have all come out in support of Biden.“Just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal,” she told CNN. “It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed.”Whitmer has been clashing with Republicans in her state over coronavirus lockdown orders that some claim is too extreme. The state has seen protests, including one on Thursday that stormed Michigan’s Capitol building.Biden has been accused by a former aide of sex assault dating back to the 90s. Biden has denied the charge.Reade told the Associated Press she filed a limited report with a congressional personnel office that did not explicitly accuse him of sexual assault or harassment.“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” Reade said in an interview Friday with the AP. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.”

Dr. Anthony Stephen Fauci didn’t grow up wanting to be famous. Mostly he just wanted to make a difference. But now a lifetime of service has flicked on a searing spotlight.Perhaps not since the late actor Jack Palance did one-armed push-ups at the 1991 Oscars at age 73 – YouTube it, millennials – has the nation been this seduced by a senior citizen. By virtue of his calm, Brooklyn-inflected White House briefings on the coronavirus pandemic that frequently if diplomatically contradict statements by President Donald Trump, Fauci, 79, has become a meme, spawned fan clubs and been lovingly parodied by Brad Pitt.Fauci’s longtime official title is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health. But since becoming the face of the country's COVID-19 pandemic, the career immunologist who has battled everything from AIDS to Ebola is increasingly referred to as America’s Doctor.And he's in the headlines again this week, having been barred by the White House from addressing House lawmakers Wednesday on the topic of the administration's response to the crisis. Instead, Fauci will meet with a GOP-led subcommittee on May 12.So just who is Tony Fauci?Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House.Alex Brandon, AP ImagesInterviews with friends and colleagues offer overlapping descriptions of a man as dedicated to hard work – endless hours peppered with power walks – as he is to his wife, scientist Christine Grady, and three accomplished daughters.They describe a man who takes as much pride in his Bolognese pasta sauce (the key, one friend says, is the long simmering time) as he does in enduring relationships. He's a burger-and-beer-at-the-bar guy, but he's also a public servant built for our trying times.“Tony’s capable of elevating his game to whatever is needed, and more has been demanded of him now than in any time in his career,” says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “In the eyes of the American public, he’s the voice we need right now, one of credibility.”Steven Gabbe met Fauci when both were at Cornell Medical College in New York City in the late 1960s, and “the person you see now on TV is the same guy I met back then, smart and humble.”Gabbe, emeritus CEO of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, lauds his friend’s sense of humor. "I’m sure he finds it entertaining that there are bobblehead dolls of him now," he says. "But he’s so grounded I don’t think it would go to his head.”Fauci would be excused it if did. In a recent survey of 1,900 registered U.S. voters, Morning Consult asked respondents whom they would trust "a lot" or "some" to end social distancing. Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention topped the list among all voters with 71% trust ratings.Three months in: A timeline of how COVID-19 has unfolded in the USSuch a high-profile status inevitably also has generated criticism.Right-wing pundits have assailed how shelter-in-place guidelines he supported have affected the economy, leading conservative internet TV host Bill Mitchell to tweet “this Dr. Doom Fauci is the most depressing idiot I’ve ever listened to.”That harsh assessment has some grounding in a real issue, says Jonathan Engel, professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York system.“Cost-benefit analysis is not the way Fauci thinks. He’s a physician and immunologist,”  Engel says. “So that’s where the frustration in some red states comes from. You’re saving lives, but you’re also destroying lives. Someone else needs to be there to step back and think about the whole picture, but that’s not Fauci’s role.”Get daily coronavirus updates in your inbox: Sign up for our newsletter now.Critics ask: Did Fauci 'miss it'?Even some fellow scientists who praise Fauci’s professional accomplishments suggest not only that he was late sounding the alarm, but that having one celebrated virus point person is dangerous.“In January, February and part of March there was one physician on show after show, him, and while he’s great at explaining things in terms of telling the country to get prepared, he missed it,” says Marty Makary, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “My concern is not with Anthony Fauci as much as it is in a media and policy world that puts its faith in one person.”USA TODAY NetworkDave GranlundIf anything, Fauci’s rise highlights the fact that no one person regardless of their stature – his laurels include almost every scientific accolade short of a Nobel Prize – should hold all the reins when it comes to national and global pandemics.“Tony’s taken on this big role in part because of the vacuum that exists,” says David Relman, a Fauci friend and professor of medicine at Stanford University.“But what if the next pandemic destroys our food? Or a bioterror attack?” he says. “We need a new leadership system that sits inside the White House, where people have the authority to tell the attorney general what to do, or the Federal Reserve or the secretary of defense, so you can move fast. Tony can’t do that. No one can. The system needs to change.”Fauci’s national stature indeed appears unique in U.S. history, says historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University in Houston, citing past examples that fall short.In the late 1700s, a yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia caused President George Washington to flee the city, leaving in charge the preeminent doctor and fellow Founding Father, Benjamin Rush.When President Woodrow Wilson got sick while visiting Paris during World War I, many scholars believe his physician and his wife were running the country for a spell.“So you have moments when doctors have become the voice of the country, but nothing like this,” Brinkley says. “The straight-talking Fauci is what you want to hear, much like if you go to a doctor you don’t want spin or blarney.”A Washington, D.C., bar joined forces with a real estate company to make these Fauci Pouchy cocktails, the proceeds of which go to a local food bank. The drinks are just another marker of Anthony Fauci's pop culture stardom as he continues to guide the nation through the coronavirus crisis.Courtesy of Regan PuryearBrinkley says that after the coronavirus pandemic starts to recede, Fauci is likely to go down in history “as one of few scientists who are now household names.”Some suggest Fauci enjoys this new spotlight too much. Although an NIAID press officer said Fauci was too busy for an interview, the doctor's media appearances are frequent and varied, from network news and comedy shows to online interviews with sports icons such as basketball star Steph Curry.Fauci Pouchys and 'Docta Fauci'And yet the public can’t seem to get enough. The Anthony Fauci Fan Club on Twitter has 24,000 followers and a pinned tweet that reads: “If you don’t have a crush on this man, do you even care about public health?”New York-based singer Missy Modell rewrote the lyrics to Lady Gaga’s 2008 hit “Paparazzi” to rhyme with “Docta Fauci.” Her Instagram hit includes the line “Tony, there’s no other superstar except for Andy,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Fauci’s likeness is splashed on coffee mugs, T-shirts and even donuts. In Washington, D.C., the town Fauci calls home, Capo’s Speakeasy teamed up with a real estate company to sell Fauci Pouchy to-go drinks, cocktails in see-through sealed bags emblazoned with the doctor's image.At Chef Geoff’s in northwest D.C., Fauci and his wife, a nurse bioethicist at the NIH, are regulars who in pre-virus times would pull up bar stools and order Chef Geoff Burgers and beers, says owner Geoff Tracy. He posted a sign warning takeout customers, “Dr. Antony Fauci is a long time guest and he wants SIX FEET.”“He’s a genuinely nice human being, and I deal with a lot who aren’t sometimes,” says Tracy, whose wife, CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell, has interviewed Fauci over the years. Tracy says Fauci’s ascent into the pop culture firmament doesn’t surprise him. But he doubts it fazes Fauci.Geoff Tracy, who runs Chef Geoff's in Washington, D.C., stands next to a sign inspired by a frequent diner, Anthony Fauci. Tracy says Fauci and his wife Christine are "burger and beer" type patrons, and have stopped by on occasion for take-out during the pandemic.Courtesy of Regan Puryear“My father-in-law is an infectious disease doctor, and these guys are not about picking fights or the limelight,” Tracy says. “They’re about sharing information and guiding you. And no one’s better at that than Tony.”Fauci recently told an interviewer he appreciated the way “classy” actor Brad Pitt played him on a recent "Saturday Night Live" stay-at-home broadcast, this after Fauci said in an interview that Pitt would be his top choice for someone to impersonate him on the show. But friends note celebrities don't fluster him.Stanford professor Relman, who focuses on microbiology and immunology, recalls talking to Fauci about the time U2 singer Bono, who has focused his philanthropy on Africa, wanted to discuss disease issues with Fauci.“Tony thought it would cause too big a scene at the NIH, so he just told Bono to come over to his house,” Relman says. “Bono did, but Tony forgot that that might completely freak out his daughters, which it did. Those are just his circles. His ability to talk honestly about important matters causes people to seek him out.”Study: Americans trust Fauci more than Trump or their own governorsFauci's hoop dreams dashed by heightFauci grew up in Brooklyn the grandson of Italian immigrants. His parents ran a pharmacy. He did deliveries on his bicycle, while his older sister Denise ran the register.In past interviews, Fauci hasn’t revealed much about his hardworking upbringing except to say that it laid the foundation for a life ultimately devoted to science and public service.Fauci went to Regis High School in Manhattan, which required commuting for hours on buses and subways. Although a standout basketball player, his height, 5-foot-7, prompted him to look for a career outside sports.For college, he attended Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, which like Regis was run by Jesuits, whose educational philosophy seeks to meld spirituality – Fauci is a lifelong Catholic – with social justice.Director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health Anthony Fauci and his wife Christine Grady arrive at the White House for a state dinner October 18, 2016 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty ImagesAlex Wong, Getty ImagesThe experience was formative, says Eric Goosby, a distinguished professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco who met Fauci in the 1980s and has been a frequent guest at his friend’s pasta Bolognese dinners. (“He’ll call me days before to make sure I’m still coming,” he says with a laugh.)“Tony was deeply affected by exposure to the Jesuit order, which fostered in him a self-expectation of service,” Goosby says. “This guy goes to sleep and wakes up asking, 'Have I done everything I can do?' It’s in his DNA.”As is a fierce work ethic. In summers during college, Fauci worked construction. As the story goes, one job found him helping on a new building at the Cornell Medical College. Fauci vowed one day he would be an alum, and he made it happen.“That story says it all to me,” says his friend Gabbe. “He just has this powerful drive that won’t be stopped. The same thing happened when he graduated and told people he was going to the NIH to study infectious diseases. People told him they were all conquered, this was a career-killer move. Not long after, AIDS hit.”Fauci’s role in the AIDS epidemic changed him. At first, he tackled the growing crisis with a measured, data-driven approach to trying to find a treatment. But that methodical tack infuriated gay activists watching friends die daily.“Initially, Fauci was very rigid in his approach to AIDS, and people like (gay rights activist and playwright) Larry Kramer got in his face, calling him the worst things,” says Baruch College professor Engel, who wrote “The Epidemic: A Global History of AIDS.” “And to Fauci’s credit, he got it and he changed.”Fauci had been seen as the detached scientific face of an uncaring administration led by President Ronald Reagan, late to understanding the scope of the AIDS crisis. Fauci started to meet with members of the gay rights community and quickly understood the need to include those who were suffering in finding a solution.Nina Pham is hugged by Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, outside of National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., on Friday. Pham, the first nurse diagnosed with Ebola after treating an infected man at a Dallas hospital, is free of the virus.Pablo Martinez Monsivais, APGoosby, who was running of one the nation’s first AIDS clinics in the late ‘80s, recalls attending a meeting with Fauci in Washington. The gathering was attacked by ACT UP activists, who locked the meeting’s attendees, there to discuss new drugs to fight HIV, inside the hall with chains.“A lot of us were nervous and scared of possible violence,” Goosby recalls. “But Tony looked at us and said: ‘This is our chance to learn about the frustrations of the community. It’s an opportunity for us to learn and serve.’ I’ll never forget that.”Fauci turned enemies into alliesThat shift in attitude – away from the rigidity of scientific pursuits and towards an embrace of the human reality – soon turned enemies into lifelong friends, says Matt Sharp, a San Francisco-based AIDS survivor and activist who was part of many ACT UP protests in the nation’s capital aimed at calling out Fauci.“What developed was a very interesting mutual respect, where you have a hero who once was an enemy,” Sharp says. “Once we got him to relate to us and our reality, trust was established. Today, the AIDS community is glad he’s the one leading this effort right now.”Over what is now nearly a 50-year career with the NIH, Fauci has worked for presidents as philosophically wide-ranging as Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, helping them through crises that included the post-9/11 anthrax scares, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009 and Ebola in 2014.Those who know Fauci marvel at how he keeps his political leanings private.“I honestly don’t know if he’s a Democrat or Republican,” says Sharp. “But I know he’s got an amazing grace and an ability to cut through the (bull). That’s his genius.”That skill is particularly valuable now as Fauci continues to navigate his truth-telling role for a president whose response to criticism often is dismissal.  “He has always had a knack for telling it like it is, and letting the political chips fall where they may,” says Stanford’s Relman. “Don’t forget, Tony Fauci is a proud card-carrying New Yorker. He has a blunt, endearing and no-nonsense New York attitude, and I think Trump kind of gets that.”Brad Pitt as Dr. Anthony Fauci during the "Fauci Cold Open" on Saturday, April 25, 2020.NBCIndeed, a brief #FireFauci firestorm that flared in the wake of Fauci appearing to show exasperation at the president’s coronavirus remarks ended with Trump saying Fauci wasn’t going anywhere.That’s probably just fine with Fauci. He may not get much sleep these days, and he’s contending with political forces dueling over just how much reopening the country will lead to another coronavirus case spike and then more shutdowns.But friends insist he’d wouldn’t want to be anywhere other than in this hot seat. Says Osterholm of the University of Minnesota: "I would go so far as to say Tony's been the right man for the job for several decades now."The recipe for that success perhaps can be found in remarks Fauci made around this time in 2016 to the graduating class at Ohio State University.Fauci started out by telling the graduates – in his trademark Brooklyn patois that made “honor” sound like on-AH and “poverty” like PAW-vaty – that if they’re like him, they’ll soon forget every word their commencement speaker said.Then over the next 12 succinct minutes, Fauci laid out five credos to live by: Be a perpetual student, expect the unexpected, embrace public service, lead by example, and, finally, pursue happiness.As prescriptions go, Fauci has taken his own medicine. When he is at that West Wing lectern, he seems to radiate a sense of satisfaction at simply being of service despite the attendant slings and arrows of the post. “Different pursuits provide joy," Fauci urged the graduates. "Find your source of joy, and embrace it.”

A special envoy to the World Health Organization on the coronavirus said in an interview Sunday that the global economy may have to assume that there will not be a vaccine and consider ways to approach the virus a “constant threat."Dr. David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, told CNN that societies need to get into the position where they can defend against it while getting on with daily lives. He pointed out that some viruses do not have a vaccine. The report pointed out that some vaccines are in the trial stage and some experts are optimistic due to the fact that COVID-19 is not known to mutate at a fast rate.“There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,” he told CNN. “We can’t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine all appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.”The Center for Infectious Disease Research at the University of Minnesota recently suggested that COVID-19 will linger for the next two years and countries should be prepared for “periodic” outbreaks. The report said containment will be so challenging due, in part, to the fact that so many of those infected are asymptomatic, according to Bloomberg.It has been widely reported that without a proven treatment, vaccine or cure, governments will have to limit social interaction. The coronavirus is considered highly contagious and most dangerous for the elderly population and those with comorbidities. Health officials in the U.S. believe that shelter-in-place orders contributed to a lower-than-expected infection rate.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a coronavirus press briefing earlier last month that the world may never return to the “normal” that was known before the outbreak."When we get back to normal, we will go back to the point where we can function as a society,” he said.  He continued, “If you want to get back to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense that the threat is there."

Michael Jordan was a notorious competitor on the court, always looking for an edge, no matter how minute. The six-time NBA champion was the same way at home, pushing his kids to be their best. He didn’t take it easy on them in basketball, either.“He would treat us exactly the same as any other basketball player he was playing,” one of Jordan’s sons, Marcus, said on NBC’s “Today” show to discuss the documentary, “The Last Dance,” that chronicles his legendary father’s final season with the Bulls.Jordan and his two sons, Marcus and Jeffrey, would often play a game of one-on-one-on-one against each other. Whoever scored got to keep the ball.“The game got so competitive [one time], to the point I literally had to call my mom, [and tell her], ‘Dad’s picking on me,’ ” Marcus said. “I was a freshman in high school. There was nothing given. You had to earn everything.”Marcus played three of college basketball at Central Florida from 2009-11, averaging 12.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. Jeffrey also played in college, for Illinois and Central Florida from 2007-12, averaging 1.6 points per game between the two programs.
The coronavirus pandemic has changed a lot of things, but one thing that it hasn't changed is Apple releasing new products. And benchmarks test results suggest that Apple has a new 13-inch MacBook Pro in the works.Well, maybe it won't be the 13-inch model, but more on that in a moment.Must read: Can a simple charging mistake cause your MacBook Pro to overheat?Twitter user @_rogame discovered 3DMark benchmarks for the new MacBook Pro.As you might imagine, there's not a whole lot of information.    Intel Core i7-1068NG7 2.3GHz base 4.1GHz boost processor    32GB of RAM    2/4TB SSDThe i7-1068NG7 processor is a 10th-gen Intel Ice Lake-U chip that as of yet has not been officially confirmed yet. The switch to Ice Lake-U from Whiskey Lake-U is likely to be a significant performance boost. Given the spec of this system, it seems to be a high-end offering and would cost in excess of $3,000. It's likely that Apple would release a more affordable version powered by a Core i5 processor too. The most interesting this about this "leak" is the suggestion that this may not be a 13-inch MacBook Pro, but instead a new 14-inch model -- Apple's bumped the 15-inch MBP to 16-inch, so why not upgrade the 13-inch to 14-inch?

The prospect of mining asteroids and the Moon is on a lot of peoples’ minds lately. Maybe it’s all the growth that’s happened in the commercial aerospace industry in the past few decades. Or perhaps it’s because of Trump’s recent executive order to allow for asteroid and lunar mining. Either way, there is no shortage of entrepreneurs and futurists who can’t wait to start prospecting and harvest the natural bounty of space!Coincidentally enough, future lunar miners now have a complete map of the lunar surface, which was created by the US Geological Society’s (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center, in collaboration with NASA and the Lunar Planetary Institute (LPI). This map shows the distribution and classification of the mineral deposits on the Moon’s surface, effectively letting us know what its familiar patchwork of light and dark patches the really are.Known as the “Unified Geologic Map of the Moon,” this immensely-detailed 1:5,000,000 scale map is available online and is intended for use by the scientific community, educators, and the general public. In addition, the USGS states that it will serve as a “definitive blueprint of the moon’s surface geology for future human missions.” Said current USGS Director and former NASA astronaut Jim Reilly in a USGS statement:“People have always been fascinated by the moon and when we might return. So, it’s wonderful to see USGS create a resource that can help NASA with their planning for future missions.”To create the new digital map, scientists at the USGS synthesized data from six of the Apollo missions along with updated information from recent satellite missions. These include the Wide Angle Camera (WAC) element of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), as well as its Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) – which gathered images and topographical data on the Moon during the LRO’s ten-year mission.Then there was the elevation data of the moon’s equatorial region, which was obtained by the Terrain Camera on JAXA’s SELenological and Engineering ExpLorEr (SELENE). Also known as Kaguya, this recent mission conducted stereo observations of the Moon’s equatorial region. Mission data was from both missions was used to update the northern and southern polar regions of the Moon.In addition to merging new data and old, the USGS researchers also developed a unified description of the rock layers on the Moon (aka. stratigraphy). This resolved issues with previous maps, which included inconsistencies with names, descriptions, and ages. Said Corey Fortezzo, USGS geologist and the lead author of the study describing the map:“This map is a culmination of a decades-long project. It provides vital information for new scientific studies by connecting the exploration of specific sites on the moon with the rest of the lunar surface.”The research that led to this map was made possible due to a grant issued by the NASA Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) program. In the coming years, the data contained within is likely to inform surface operations for Project Artemis, which are scheduled to begin in 2024 with the Artemis III mission.This will be the first time that astronauts have gone to the Moon since the Apollo era. But unlike the heady days of the Space Race, NASA is intent on establishing a program for “sustainable lunar exploration” this time around, which includes elements that will allow for a permanent human presence on the Moon – like the Lunar Gateway and the Lunar Base Camp. Commercial access to the Moon has been an important part of this plan from the beginning. In addition to partnering with aerospace companies to develop these and other elements that will make future missions to the Moon possible, NASA’s long-term plans include partnering with other space agencies and companies so that they can use this same infrastructure to facilitate their own missions and goals.On top of that, the legal precedents for commercial ventures on the Moon began before the executive order, titled “Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources.” In 2015, the Obama administration signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act into law to “facilitate a pro-growth environment for the developing commercial space industry.”Now that companies and individual citizens have the right to claim, own, and sell resources that they extract from asteroids and other celestial bodies, a comprehensive map of where those resources are (at least on the Moon) is going to come in mighty handy! In the meantime, it is one heck of a scientific and educational resource and is likely to lead to some exciting breakthroughs in astrogeological research.

Researchers at Utrecht University, Erasmus Medical Center and Harbour BioMed (HBM) today reported that they have identified a fully human monoclonal antibody that prevents the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus from infecting cultured cells. The discovery, published online today in Nature Communications, is an initial step towards developing a fully human antibody to treat or prevent the respiratory disease COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe infecting more than 3.3M people worldwide and killing more than 235,000 people so far."This research builds on the work our groups have done in the past on antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002/2003," said Berend-Jan Bosch, Associate Professor, Research leader at Utrecht University, and co-lead author of the Nature Communications study. "Using this collection of SARS-CoV antibodies, we identified an antibody that also neutralizes infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells. Such a neutralizing antibody has potential to alter the course of infection in the infected host, support virus clearance or protect an uninfected individual that is exposed to the virus."Dr. Bosch noted that the antibody binds to a domain that is conserved in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, explaining its ability to neutralize both viruses. "This cross-neutralizing feature of the antibody is very interesting and suggests it may have potential in mitigation of diseases caused by future-emerging related coronaviruses.""This discovery provides a strong foundation for additional research to characterize this antibody and begin development as a potential COVID-19 treatment," said Frank Grosveld, PhD. co-lead author on the study, Academy Professor of Cell Biology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam and Founding Chief Scientific Officer at Harbour BioMed. "The antibody used in this work is 'fully human,' allowing development to proceed more rapidly and reducing the potential for immune-related side effects." Conventional therapeutic antibodies are first developed in other species and then must undergo additional work to 'humanize' them. The antibody was generated using Harbour BioMed's H2L2 transgenic mouse technology."This is groundbreaking research," said Dr. Jingsong Wang, Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HBM. "Much more work is needed to assess whether this antibody can protect or reduce the severity of disease in humans. We expect to advance development of the antibody with partners. We believe our technology can contribute to addressing this most urgent public health need and we are pursuing several other research avenues."The paper is titled, "A human monoclonal antibody blocking SARS-VoV-2 Infection. In addition to Drs. Bosch and Grosveld, authors on the paper included: Chunyan Wang, Wentao Li and Frank van Kuppeveld of Utrecht University; Nisreen Okba and Bart Haagmans of Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam); Dubravka Drabek and Rien van Haperen of Erasmus Medical Center and Harbour Antibodies; and Albert Osterhaus of the University of Veterinary Medicine (Hannover, Germany).

Troubled Scott Disick has checked himself into a luxury addiction treatment center in The Rocky Mountains after relapsing with booze and drugs, DailyMailTV can exclusively reveal.The reality star arrived at the exclusive All Points North Lodge in Edwards, Colorado last Tuesday.Sources say Disick, known for his hard partying and multiple stints in rehab, has been drinking heavily and taking cocaine while in coronavirus lockdown.It's understood the 36-year-old has struggled with family life during lockdown and is still having a hard time coping with the loss of both his parents a few years ago.After arriving at the brand new resort-style mountain retreat, which opened its doors in March, Disick was placed under immediate COVID-19 quarantine and confined to his private suite.The star was tested for coronavirus and once given the all clear, was allowed to join other patients at the facility Friday.A source told DailyMailTV: 'Scott flew in on Tuesday and had to Zoom in to a group meeting from his room to introduce himself.'He said he's having trauma from his past, he mentioned trouble with his ex and said he's also having trouble with his children and he's been taking cocaine and drinking a lot.'He looked pretty skinny and told the group he was coming to rehab to work on his issues and said he was having withdrawal symptoms and was tired and lethargic.'He told staff he didn't want any special treatment during his stay, in terms of meals and therapy.' Disick has long had issues with alcoholism and drug use to combat his personal problems.And on last Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the reality star confessed that he still struggles to deal with losing both his parents within three months of each other - especially now that his kids have begun to ask about them.His mom Bonnie passed away in 2013 after a long illness, while his father Jeff died of unknown causes in 2014 and only child Disick was extremely close to them.And Disick, who shares three children with ex Kourtney Kardashian, 41, revealed that he has been going through a few personal struggles.He and Kourtney were together on and off for 12 years, and share children Mason, 10, and Penelope, seven, and Reign, five together. He said on the show: 'Losing my parents is not an easy subject for me to talk about, It puts me in a very vulnerable place, to remember them and think about them.'In the past Disick has yo-yoed in and out of rehab as he battled to overcome his demons.His troubles with alcohol and drugs reached an all-time high in 2014 when he downed a bottle of sleeping pills.He immediately made an attempt at recovery at a rehab facility in Connecticut.But just when it seemed that he might finally leave his hard-partying ways behind, he checked out early.In July, 2015 Disick and Kourtney split for good when pictures surfaced of him getting cozy with his ex-girlfriend Chloe Bartoli in Monte Carlo and the star began to unravel once again.In October 2015, he checked into a facility in Malibu for drug and alcohol abuse, after previously seeking treatment in Costa Rica and Florida.And in early 2016, after another bender of cocaine, vodka, beer and Viagra, Disick was reportedly discovered unresponsive in bed at his Los Angeles home.In August, 2017 after months of hard partying, womanizing and bizarre behavior, Disick was hospitalized yet again near his home in the exclusive Hidden Hills gated community near Calabasas.In September 2017 Disick met current girlfriend Sofia Richie, Lionel Richie's daughter, and seemed to clean up his act.Now family and friends hope the troubled star can get himself cleaned up once and for all at the 72-room luxury wellness retreat, which is a former five star hotel nestled in the heart of The Rocky Mountains.The 77,000-square-foot lodge stands at the top of a ridge and has the look of a majestic European castle, boasting sweeping views across the Eagle Valley.Interestingly, the property, formerly the Cordillera Lodge & Spa, became infamous in 2003 when a 19-year-old concierge accused basketball superstar Kobe Bryant of sexual assault at the resort.The hotel was bought by Malibu-based APN Capital in 2016 and founder Noah Nordheimer is overseeing a $136 million investment in the high-end project.The property was given a $20 million makeover and with a price point of between $40,000 to $120,000 a month, it caters for celebrities, musicians, high net worth individuals and top athletes.According to the website, the facility helps 'clients struggling with addiction, mental health challenges, trauma, and major life decisions to better understand and manage their lives.'The state-of-the-art center has outdoor and indoor swimming pools and hot tubs, hyperbaric chambers, a float tank, high end gym and spa, and offers massages, acupuncture, yoga, boxing and an art therapy room.It also offers a slew of outdoor activities including hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, white water rafting, camping and skiing and snowboarding in the winter.A world-class team of medical professionals, mental health clinicians, nutritionists, and fitness trainers help patients through specially customized programs.Programs take a minimum of one month with some patients staying three months and longer.The one-of-a-kind addiction treatment program uses science-based intervention with health, fitness, medicine and psychiatry, instead of the traditional 12-step approach.The source added: 'It's a pretty nice high end place and the team is filled with experts from Florida.'It's not as restrictive as some places, you can use your phone for an hour during lunch and two hours in the evening and you get intense therapy, they're big on group therapy.' 
Britain has the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe, official figures showed on Tuesday, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic.The government’s tally of fatalities across the UK reached 29,427 for those who tested positive for coronavirus, exceeding the 29,029 recorded in Italy – until now Europe’s worst-hit country. Italy’s total does not include suspected cases.Newly released data from the Office for National Statistics showed that 29,648 deaths were registered in England and Wales with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate by 2 May. With the addition of the official death figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland, this was calculated to take the UK’s toll to 32,313.The true figure is likely to be significantly higher due to missed cases and a lag in reporting.While experts such as Prof David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), have warned of the risks of comparing countries’ death tolls, he said on Tuesday: “We are not doing very well and it’s been another very bad week. I really don’t like this league table of who’s top and who’s not, but there’s no denying that these are really serious numbers.”Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association trade union, said Britain having the highest number of deaths in Europe showed that ministers had “searching questions” to answer about their “inadequate” handling of the crisis, and called for a public inquiry.“This is a very sobering and unwelcome milestone. It’s of extreme concern that the UK now has the largest number of Covid deaths in Europe,” she said. “There will have to be a full investigation of the [government’s] handling of the Covid response in due course – a public inquiry – to understand why we are experiencing such large numbers in comparison to the rest of Europe.“It puts into question whether the government’s tactics at the start of the pandemic were sufficiently fast, and especially whether the lockdown should have happened earlier and whether we should have been better prepared with increased capacity for viral testing and contact tracing from the start. Both have proven inadequate.”Dr Chaand Nagpaul, British Medical Association council chair, said the figures were extremely concerning “given that the UK was originally affected by the outbreak later than many other nations, and with the government initially saying that a death toll of 20,000 would be a ‘good outcome’.”“It’s too early to come to firm conclusions and we need to ensure that figures between nations are comparing like for like,” he said. “However, there will in the future need to be serious scrutiny of the UK’s response and questions asked about what measures were put in when, from imposition of lockdown to our approach to testing, and whether this may have contributed to the loss of more lives.”The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Today’s confirmation we have the highest official death rate in Europe is a tragic reminder of the severity of this horrific disease. The public will rightly ask why our death rate is so high.”Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, repeated previous warnings by ministers and experts against making international comparisons, describing it as “speculation” to say the UK had the highest death toll in Europe.“I don’t think we’ll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over and particularly until we’ve got comprehensive international data on all cause of mortality,” he said.“We now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that so I’m not sure that the international comparison works unless you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way.” Italy quickly became a centre of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, with the first deaths coming in late February, and it was the first European country to move into lockdown.As the death toll rose, so did the number of theories about what went wrong. Italy’s large ageing population, culture of close social interactions and densely populated cities, as well as a lack of time to prepare and a slow initial response to the virus were among the reasons cited as why the country was so badly hit.The UK, it was said, should learn from Italy. Now, it seems it could be at least as badly struck.The latest ONS figures show that 21,997 people died from all causes in the week ending 24 April, which is 11,539 more than the average for that week.That total was 354 fewer than the record level of 22,351 the week before, however. This was the first decrease in weekly deaths since the start of the outbreak and supports other figures showing that the UK is past the peak of coronavirus infections.The increase in Covid-19 deaths only partly explains the unprecedented levels in total deaths. The reasons behind an extra 3,312 deaths in the week ending 24 April remain unclear, with speculation that they could have been caused by delayed hospital admissions for other life-threatening conditions and other factors such as economic hardship, and mental health problems.Spiegelhalter said: “Well over 3,000 [of the excess deaths] weren’t labelled as Covid. So nearly a third were from something else. There is a continuing anxiety that many of these are due to the lockdown itself.“The one thing we do know is that the health service has been hugely disrupted, not just in terms of routine care, cancelled chemotherapies and radio therapies and elective surgeries, but also of people with symptoms not going to hospital.”Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, called for an urgent review into deaths caused indirectly by the virus. “We urgently need to identify the cause of these deaths. There are many plausible theories as to their cause, however, we need real data on this urgently,” he said. “As we go forward, we want to minimise all deaths, not just those tagged as Covid-19.”The latest figures also show that total care home deaths were 595 higher than the week before, at 7,911, whereas hospital deaths were 1,191 lower, at 8,243.Of the coronavirus deaths registered up to 1 May in England and Wales, 6,686 took place in care homes, which was 22.5% of all the deaths from the virus at that point, the ONS figures show.Provisional charts shared with journalists by Spiegelhalter showed coronavirus deaths in care homes now exceeding deaths in hospitals. He said: “I can be pretty confident that these [lines representing deaths in care homes and hospitals] have actually crossed a week or so ago with more Covid deaths happening out of hospital than in hospital.” He added that it was too early to tell whether deaths in care homes had peaked.For the first time last week, the government began including data on deaths outside hospitals in cases where people had tested positive for coronavirus, in the daily death toll figures for the virus. By contrast the ONS figures include all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on death certificates. 
ROME — Wearing a Plexiglas visor, large white mask and blue rubber gloves, Catia Gabrielli looked ready for whatever could come her way on Monday as Italy tentatively loosened some of its strictest lockdown provisions against the coronavirus.“I see a lot more movement,” Ms. Gabrielli, a bookstore owner, said in the historic center of Rome as she worried about the people around her, out taking walks without masks. “It’s a lot of people.”That same wariness mixed with hope was expressed throughout Europe and beyond on Monday as at least a dozen countries — including Germany, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Lithuania, France, Nigeria and Lebanon — began to ease weeks of restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the contagion.But in many places, the much-anticipated relaxation of restrictions looked a lot like a real-time experiment in figuring out how to live with the virus. And while the easing varied country to country, many leaders made clear that things could be shut down again — if citizens grew suddenly too incautious.In most countries, not all stores and industry were allowed to resume business. School openings were selective, carried out in reconfigured classrooms, or put off till the fall. Social-distancing rules were still in force. Masks were often required. Bars, cafes and restaurants largely remained shuttered.Italian authorities warned that any loosening of restrictions could be short lived if citizens didn’t adhere to social-distancing measures. And if infections shot up again and overwhelmed health systems just coming up for air, they would lock society back down.“We will intervene and close the tap,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy has said, warning Italians of the dangers of bringing up the curve of infections that the country had worked so hard to suppress. In Italy, the virus has claimed more than 28,000 lives.The problem with relaxing restrictions is that officials will not have a reliable sign of the consequences for at least two weeks — the incubation period of the virus. So there remains the risk that in the blind gap, the virus stealthily surges, setting off another wave of infections, as bad or worse than the first.Public health experts, while recognizing the need to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoods, have long warned that opening up shops and releasing citizens from their homes could be more difficult and dangerous than shutting them in.Even so, India allowed businesses, local transportation and activities like weddings to resume in areas with few or no known infections. Lebanon reopened bars and restaurants.Nigeria relaxed lockdowns in its capital, Abuja, and its biggest city, Lagos, with markets, stores, malls and construction companies opening.In Germany, which has reported 163,100 infections and 6,692 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute, zoos, museums, hairdressers and barbershops opened on Monday for the first time since mid-March.On Sunday, 122 pre-screened worshipers convened in Cologne Cathedral, wearing masks and sitting apart in pews, to celebrate Mass. Other churches will begin services, under similar restrictions, later this week.Some playgrounds opened over the weekend.“It is a huge relief,” said Katherin Bravo, who guided her nearly 2-year-old daughter down a Berlin slide. “You can’t explain to little children why they can’t play here. We would walk by every day and she would say, ‘slide, slide,’ but we had to keep going.”In Spain, where more than 25,000 people have died, small businesses reopened on Monday.The government hopes to return the country to a “new normalcy” by late June, letting some areas with less contagion and hospital saturation open up earlier than more infected parts.Cristina Cros, who owns a small salon in Barcelona, said she was happy to return to work after seven weeks of lockdown, but was also finding the new rules “pretty chaotic.”For example, all clients must stay at least two meters, or roughly six feet, apart while in the salon. The hairdresser must thoroughly clean the premises after each client, and also mop the floor two or three times a day, Ms. Cros explained.“I have been doing as much cleaning as cutting so far,” Ms. Cros said, wearing a mask and gloves, just like her customer.

Microsoft has repurposed Windows 10X, the new cut of its OS introduced in October 2019 to run on dual-screen devices.When announcing Windows 10X Microsoft said it "is designed for new dual-screen PCs and not as an OS upgrade if you already own a PC." Microsoft also suggested that users who put the OS in harness with dual-screen devices would experience amazing productivity boosts. And then it said both Windows 10X and dual-screen gadgetry like its own Surface Neo would appear for pre-Christmas-2020 sales.Now Microsoft has backed away from Windows 10X as a built-for-dual-screen Windows, and cast doubt on when dual-screen gadgets will appear.A new post by chief product officer for windows and devices Panos Panay said:“With Windows 10X, we designed for flexibility, and that flexibility has enabled us to pivot our focus toward single-screen Windows 10X devices that leverage the power of the cloud to help our customers work, learn and play in new ways. These single-screen devices will be the first expression of Windows 10X that we deliver to our customers, and we will continue to look for the right moment, in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market.”What’s changed?A certain virus, from the sound of things.“The world is a very different place than it was last October when we shared our vision for a new category of dual-screen Windows devices,” Panay wrote. “As we continue to put customers’ needs at the forefront, we need to focus on meeting customers where they are now. Our customers are leveraging the power of the cloud more than ever, and we believe the time is right to lean into this acceleration in a different way.”Microsoft will reveal what that means at its virtual Build conference from May 18th. Panay teased that news by saying “We are going to share how we will reduce complexity for developers by making it easier than ever to build for all 1 billion Windows 10 devices, all at once. We will share how we will enable developers to build applications that seamlessly enable cloud-powered virtualization.”The post does not, however, offer any explanation about how the promised productivity revolution delivered by the combo of dual screen devices and Windows 10X will come about with the OS on single-screen devices. Or if the announcements planned for Build will reveal those plans.All is not lost because 10X had architectural interest beyond the dual-screen angle. As Microsoft explained when announcing the OS, 10X would include "newly implemented support for running Win32 applications in a container" plus "further componentization and additional investments ... to deliver more flexible experiences with a wide range of input types and hardware postures all while managing Windows applications and how they use the battery."Which sounds like a worthy upgrade. Perhaps more so than the Windows 10 update emerging later this May. Panay wrote that refresh brings with it “a more streamlined way to pair Bluetooth devices in Windows” and “an improved tablet experience when you detach your 2-in-1’s keyboard, allowing you to keep the familiarity of your desktop while at the same time optimizing for touch.”Windows 10X will presumably be just a little more profound.

Skygazers can look forward to seeing several shooting stars tonight, as the Earth passes through the dust left over from Halley’s Comet.The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is expected to peak on the night of May 5, with up to 40 meteors per hour, and will be visible until the early morning of May 6.This celestial display is associated with the Halley’s Comet, officially designated 1P/Halley, which orbits the sun once every 76 years.Tania de Sales Marques, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told the PA news agency: “The last time it [Halley’s Comet] was seen in the sky was 1986, and our next chance to view it will be late in the year 2061.”The Eta Aquariids takes its name from the constellation of Aquarius in the southern hemisphere, where the shooting stars appear to originate from.Meteoroids from Halley’s Comet strike the Earth’s atmosphere at an approximate speed of 150,000 miles per hour (240,000kph), burning up in the process.Ms de Sales Marques said: “As a comet approaches the sun it heats up, releasing gas and dust into space behind it.“When that wake of debris intersects with the orbit of the Earth we experience meteor showers, as the particles fall towards the Earth and heat up upon entering the atmosphere, leaving bright streaks in the sky as they vaporise or break apart.”While the Eta Aquariids is active from late April to near the end of May, Ms de Sales Marques says the best time to see it will be on the night of May 5-6 between midnight and sunrise, when the shower will be at its peak.She said: “This is a moderately active meteor shower, with a peak rate of 40 meteors per hour, and even though its radiant will be below or only just above the horizon for those of us at London’s latitude, we can still look out for its meteors all across the sky.“Our best chance will be in the hours just before dawn, facing the eastern sky.”She advises getting far away from all artificial lights to increase the chances of catching a glimpse of the shooting stars on a moonlit night.Ms de Sales Marques said: “As with any other stargazing activity, the best way to see meteors is to find yourself a spot sheltered from city lights with an unobstructed view of the sky and look in the direction of the radiant.“The moon will be waxing gibbous throughout the night, so the sky won’t be as dark as one could hope, adding to the challenge.”

Amid rising confirmed coronavirus case counts, and a death toll that has begun to plateau, President Donald Trump spent much of Sunday lashing out at politicians, attacking the media, and bragging about his poll numbers. He also seemed to suggest Covid-19 is a cosmic or biblical force — and one that has already been stopped.Sunday morning, the president panned former President George W. Bush’s recent call for bipartisan unity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing his predecessor should have spoken up on his behalf during Trump’s impeachment process.“Let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat,” Bush said Saturday in a video message to the public. “In the final analysis, we are not partisan combatants.”Trump felt this was inappropriate, however, quoting comments made by Pete Hegseth, a weekend cohost of Fox & Friends, who asked “where [Bush] was during impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside.” To this, Trump added, “He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!”After sending out the tweet about Bush, Trump proceeded to send out one adversarial and divisive post after another.He deemed NBC and CNN “Chinese puppets who want to do business there” and “the enemy of the people.” He boasted about his approval ratings among Republicans and said that a new Gallup poll shows “Trump beating Sleepy Joe Biden.” (It does not.) He said there were “many complaints coming in” over Maine’s coronavirus response (despite the state government’s rising approval ratings) — and then added that he won the state. He also retweeted some of his old tweets, one in which he declared a video of a boat owner who painted Trump’s name onto his boat “very cool,” and another in which he falsely claims Democrats want “OPEN BORDERS.”He capped off his spree with a tweet about America coming together as a nation — and it was an odd one, in which he described an America rising from the “death and destruction” caused by “a great and powerful Plague” that led to “lost souls all over the World:”Trump’s tone in the tweet, which didn’t seem to have any obvious contextual explanation, was roundly mocked on social media by his critics. “Camus wept,” quipped Charles Pierce, a politics writer for Esquire. Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall tweeted, “tfw you try to bible-speak on twitter.”The tweet appeared to suggest the danger posed by the coronavirus had largely passed, given that it was all written in the past tense, but with its biblical language also seemed to place blame for the virus on some force greater than Trump himself, and one that he didn’t have control over.While it is true that the coronavirus is believed to have come from nature, in reality, Trump has botched countless opportunities to fight against the virus. Among many other things, he downplayed its dangers, dismantled the bureaucratic expertise required to manage a pandemic, refused to swiftly take steps to provide Americans with protective gear and medical equipment, and conditioned aid to states on political favors.These latest tweets have come during a period of heavy Twitter activity by the president. In general, Trump appears to tweet more when he feels under siege and wants to push back against particular narratives or Democratic attacks that undermine his reputation. Given that Trump is constantly under fire these days for his catastrophic mismanagement of the American coronavirus response, it’s not exactly surprising that he took to Twitter to unleash a wave of attacks.ù

Lord Alan Sugar, 73, has hit out at Piers Morgan after the GMB host shared on Twitter that he was tested for coronavirus as he is an essential key worker.Piers, 55, was concerned that he had contracted the deadly bug after coming down with symptoms but he has tested negative for Covid-19 and is soon set to return to his job hosting morning show Good Morning Britain.Government guidelines state that essential key workers such as front line health workers and social care staff - including journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting - are entitled to be tested at test points.After Piers announced that he has the all-clear and that he was "entitled" to a test as he is an "essential key worker" Lord Sugar hit out at the controversial presenter for not being an essential worker and branded him a "hypocrite" who has "deprived" others of being able to be tested.The Apprentice star pointed out that he was happy to hear that Piers did not have the deadly bug but shared that another presenter could step in for Piers if he was unwell and that he is "certainly not essential."Following Piers' tweet announcing about being tested and healthy, Lord Sugar re-tweeted the message and asked why the outspoken ITV face was classed as essential.The tweet read: "RT @piersmorgan My COVID-19 test was negative. I was entitled to do so as a Govt-designated essential worker. I'll be back on @GMB as soon as my doctor advises I'm OK to return to work. SINCERELY PLEASED TO HEAR YOU ARE NEGATIVE. HOWEVER WHY ARE YOU A GOVT ESSENTIAL WORKER ?"Alan then micro-blogged again as he lashed out: "Have I missed something ? Like the Govn "Masochist bill". According to @piersmorgan he is a Govn- designated essential worker. Does he mean the Govn see him essential to sl*g them off every day. There are other presenters to step in @gmb he is certainly not essential."Continuing to fume and musing at how Piers would act if the shoe was on the other foot, Alan then tweeted again: ". @piersmorgan not an Govn-designated essential worker. There're Nurses, Doctors, Police, Army,train and truck drivers."He deprived a real essential workers from a test.If this was Hugh Grant, Meghan or other of his enemies like me."He would be howling from the rooftops. HYPOCRITE"Lord Sugar then told his 5.3 million followers: "Frankly @piersmorgan has shot himself in the foot. He would have done better saying nothing and not mention testing. He has opened a can of worms for people to have a go at him. However good news he tested negative."On Sunday former newspaper editor Piers told fans he'd have to take a step back from GMB after suffering mild Covid-19 symptoms and was awaiting the result of a test.He tweeted: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs..."I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."Piers didn't go into what symptoms he had experienced, but did reveal he was going by medical advice.Yesterday he then announced that his results were negative and that he soon will be returning to work.During Piers' time off TV presenter Ben Shepard stood in for him and anchored the ITV news show with Susanna Ried. 
Michael Jordan knew he had screwed up right away.During a Chicago Bulls practice in 1995, Jordan got into a fight with guard Steve Kerr.Earlier this week, Kerr shared his side of the reconciliation between the two players, but Sunday, we got Jordan's side."So I go down to the locker room, and Michael says, 'I know, I lost it for a second,' " then-Bulls coach Phil Jackson said during episode No. 8 of ESPN's "The Last Dance" documentary."I'm in the shower, and I'm saying, 'Look, I just beat up the littlest guy on the f-----g court,' " Jordan said. "And I felt about this small. So when I get in the car, and I call back to the United Center, I said, 'Please give me Steve Kerr's number.' I call Steve and I apologize, and I said 'Look man, it had nothing to do with you. I feel bad.' "That phone call fixed everything between Jordan and Kerr."We talked it out, and it was probably, in a weird way, the best thing that I ever did, was stand up for myself with him because he tested everybody he played with, and I stood up to him," Kerr said on "The Last Dance."Kerr punched Jordan, but his actions won over the best player in NBA history."He earned my respect because he wasn't willing to back down to be a pawn in this whole process," Jordan said.[RELATED: Kerr self-conscious about fight]As Kerr has said all week when recounting the infamous fight, the incident brought them closer together."From that point on, our relationship dramatically improved and our trust in each other, everything, it was like 'All right, we got that out of the way, we're going to war together,' " Kerr said.They would go on to win three NBA titles together with the Bulls, and the trust that had been built led to Jordan feeding Kerr for the 1997 NBA Finals-winning shot.
For the Northern Hemisphere, spring is here – a time to start packing away winter jackets, and enjoying sunbaking on the deck.But increasing warmth can also bring fires, and in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the situation is already looking pretty dire.Russian Emergencies Minister Evgeny Zinichev has said that in Krasnoyarsk, 10 times as much territory was ablaze on April 27 compared to the same time last year, while in Transbaikal it was three times, and in the Amur region it was one and a half times as much.In the Transbaikal region alone, this amounts to 200,000 hectares burnt – a larger area than the whole island of Maui, Hawaii.And unfortunately, the cause is likely the worst mix of climate change, and COVID-19 cabin fever.According to authorities, the fires have originated from a variety of sources, including out-of-control agricultural fires, arson, and untended campfires."People self-isolated outdoors and forgot about fire safety rules," says Sergei Anoprienko, head of the federal forest agency Rosleskhoz."In some regions, the temperature is already around 30 degrees C [86 degrees F], and people just can't keep themselves in their apartments.""People rushed outdoors, and as a result we have a surge of thermal points," he added.NASA's Terra satellite captured images of some of the fires from space on April 27 (below).Currently, the area is undergoing unusually hot weather and strong winds, which as we saw earlier this year in Australia is a dangerous combination.NASA reports that winds on April 23 caused many of the fires used by locals to dry out grass to spread uncontrolled."The regions of Kemerovo and Novosibirsk among others have been the hardest hit to date," the NASA release explains. "Nine Siberian regions have been affected by these wildfires. Clouds of smoke have swept across the Siberian landscape."Scientists have shown that as the global average temperature continues to rise, and we see more and more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, these wildfires will continue to become on average larger, more dangerous, and more frequent.We already saw some pretty intense wildfires in Siberia in 2017 and 2019, and London School of Economics geographer Thomas Smith told Earther that Russia currently has 2 million hectares of grassland and forest on fire across the continent – which is not far off the horrific July 2019 figures. And it's only May.Anoprienko warned that it's very early in the season for numbers like this. He explained that by April 28 last year in TransBaikal, 382,000 hectares had been burnt. This year, the area has already had 477,000 burnt hectares.This is likely only the start of another intense fire season across the Northern Hemisphere. California has had a drier than average winter, and Europe is already experiencing particularly warm weather."An abnormally warm winter, an arid spring, and the human factor have made adjustments to our forecasts,' said Anoprienko."In May – June, a dangerous period usually begins in Siberia ... We can keep talking about the forecast for a very long time, but the actual fire situation will literally depend on us and you - on how we will behave."That probably should be a lesson to all of us. 
The coronavirus pandemic will be included in future episodes of Coronation Street but will be "handled with a light touch", the soap's producer has said.Iain MacLeod said viewers like the show because it "reflects modern Britain" and so ignoring the pandemic when filming resumes would turn the street into "a parallel fantasy land"."We took the view that it has to exist in our world," he said."However, I am also aware that people tune into Coronation Street for escapism, to some degree, and to see drama and stories that they would never normally experience in their own lives, and stuff they would normally never see in their own living rooms played out on screen."While the virus will exist in Coronation Street, we were also keen that it wouldn't dominate every single story and every single scene."If your lives are anything like mine, certainly coronavirus is pretty much the only topic of conversation in my house, but people wouldn't want to tune into Coronation Street and see every scene was people talking about coronavirus."It will be there. You will be able to see evidence of it in the way people behave - hand-washing protocols and things like that."The way our businesses are run will be tweaked to do more takeaways and the like, as food outlets are doing in the real world."But we will still continue telling the same brilliant, dramatic stories with the healthy dollop of comedy that we always do, because to do otherwise would be, again, to turn the show into something the viewers don't recognise."It will be there. It will be handled with a light touch. Other than that, our storytelling will be business as usual."MacLeod added: "People want to watch drama and they want to watch the same hard-hitting stories that Corrie does so well. They don't want suddenly to be watching a different programme."The ITV show was paused, along with fellow soap Emmerdale, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures.The channel is running fewer episodes than usual to make the supply last longer.Last week, Sky News revealed how Australian soap Neighbours is working within social-distancing restrictions.The soap seems to be leading the way, with various productions from around the world getting in touch for details on how it is operating, executive producer Jason Herbison said.

The second meteor shower in as many weeks will dazzle the eyes of stargazers around the globe, but the light show will be battling against the glow of a nearly full moon when it reaches its peak.The Eta Aquarids is an annual meteor shower in early May, and this year, reaches its climax on Monday night and the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning."This shower happens to be one of if not the best in the Southern Hemisphere," AccuWeather Astronomy Blogger Dave Samuhel said. "It is a moderate shower for the Northern Hemisphere."People living south of the equator may count as many as 40 shooting stars per hour at the height of the celestial light show, the American Meteor Society (AMS) said. This includes Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America."From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn," the AMS added.This year, the meteor shower will be peaking just two nights before the final supermoon of 2020. The bright moon may make it difficult to see some of the fainter meteors, but it should not completely wash out the shower.Of course, weather and cloud cover will significantly factor into how well sky gazers in different parts of the country are able to witness the meteor shower.Onlookers across the southern U.S. and the interior West are forecast to have the best viewing contains for 2020's iteration of the Eta Aquarids. Mainly clear conditions are also on tap for parts of New England and into Quebec.A storm gathering over the central U.S. will spread disruptive clouds over much of the Midwest and into parts of Appalachia, obscuring the night sky.Clouds could also spoil the meteor shower over the Pacific Northwest as a storm moves into the region.The Eta Aquarids will be active on the nights leading up to and immediately following the peak, so people that have cloudy weather on Monday night may be able to spot some shooting stars later in the week when the clouds clear.No special equipment is needed to watch a meteor shower, although people should pack some patience when heading out to spend some time under the stars."Give yourself a solid hour to look for meteors. Get comfortable. Lay down on a blanket, or you a reclining chair," Samuhel said.People should also avoid looking toward the moon, which will be above the horizon for most of the night. Looking at the moon can make it harder to see meteors, so try to focus in the darkest part of the sky.The best time to watch the meteor shower will be after midnight once the shower's radiant point climbs above the horizon.The radiant point is simply the part of the sky where the meteors originate, but you do not need to look in this direction so spot meteors. However, as the radiant point climbs higher in the sky, more and more meteors will able to be seen.Many of the meteor showers throughout the year are caused by debris left behind by comets when they visit the inner solar system. When this debris enters the Earth's atmosphere, it burns incredibly bright for a few brief seconds."The majority of visible meteors are caused by particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams," the AMS said.The debris that causes the Eta Aquarids is actually dust left behind by one of the most famous comets - Halley's Comet.Halley's Comet only orbits the sun once every 75 years, but each year in early May, the Earth passes through some of the debris that it left behind."The Eta Aquarids are one of two meteor showers sparked by Halley's comet. The other being the Orionids in October. "People that miss out on the Eta Aquarids will need to wait a few months before the next opportunity to catch a meteor shower.According to the AMS, the next major meteor shower will not peak until late July.
Today's Dealmaster is headed by a new round of Amazon device deals, with a number of Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, and Echo speakers and smart displays all discounted. The sale is ostensibly available for Mother's Day, though Amazon's ongoing coronavirus-induced shipping delays have made it so most of these items won't make it out in time by this weekend. Still, there are a few worthwhile offers here.One highlight is the latest Kindle Paperwhite down to $95 from a typical price of $130. We've seen it drop $5-10 cheaper on a handful of occasions, but if you're looking for a new e-reader, this is still a good price for our top pick on the market. Amazon's Fire tablets are also on sale, with the Fire HD 8 down to $60 and the Fire HD 10 down to $110. Again, we've seen all of these slates go for $10 or so cheaper in rarer sales, but each is still 20 to 25 percent off their normal going rates. While none of them can really touch Apple's iPad—which is also on sale today—the Fire HD 8 and 10 are decent values for those who only need a tablet for casual videos and Web browsing. (The entry-level Fire 7 is also on sale for $40, though that's only advisable for people who strictly want to spend as little as possible on a tablet.)Beyond that, the company's Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8 are back at their lowest prices to date—$50 and $80, respectively—for those who want an Echo speaker with a display for video calls and more involved smart home controls (and can live with Amazon's data collection policies). There are deals on the more traditional Echo and Echo Dot speakers, too, though the discounts aren't as steep, relatively speaking, as with the other gadgets here.If you have no interest in bringing Amazon further into your home, though, we also have deals on Roku's Streaming Stick+, several Bluetooth speakers and USB-C chargers, Fitbit trackers, a rare drop on security keys from Yubico, and much more. Have a look at the full list below.

Italy, one of the worst-hit countries in the pandemic, has been under a nationwide lockdown since March 9. More than 210,000 people in the European country have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and nearly 29,000 have died, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.Italy reported some 1,400 new cases on Sunday, down from its peak of around 6,600 new cases on March 21.
WIDER patient care during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is being neglected - and that could end up causing long term problems for the NHS is terms of clinical demand, Welsh doctors fear.More than 830 frontline doctors across Wales were surveyed for the British Medical Association (BMA), out of 15,000 UK-wide,.And approaching two-thirds of those from Wales said care for patients not affected by Covid-19 is either significantly worsening (37 per cent) or slightly worsening (25 per cent).Forty per cent of doctors surveyed in Wales also stated that their biggest concern is longer term care for patients.BMA Cymru, which represents doctors across Wales, fears that in the midst of the biggest health crisis in recent history, the health needs of patients have not disappeared, but their care has effectively been placed on hold whilst the NHS deals with the pandemic.There are serious concerns that some patients may have deteriorated and possibly died as a result.“The message we’re getting from doctors is clear; they are worried about the impact this pandemic will have in the long term for patients," said Gwent GP Dr David Bailey, who chairs the BMA’s Welsh Council."Whilst getting through this pandemic is the highest priority at present, equally high on the list must be ensuring that measures are in place to manage patient demand when we come out the other side.“Already, one-in-four doctors said they have been redeployed to cope with the pandemic, and if they return to their usual work as services resume, this would reduce the workforce available for dealing with the demand from Covid-19 care.“We know that many ill patients are not getting the care they need now - they are risking their conditions getting worse and some may even die as a result."Once this current situation eases, there will be a spike in demand, including from patients with far more acute illnesses, caused by a delay in timely treatment. It is vital that the Welsh NHS engages with its clinicians and plans for this now.“Welsh Government must set out a clear plan of how the system will have capacity both for the ongoing demands of the pandemic, as well as resuming services for those patients whose care has effectively been frozen.”

JACKSON, Miss. – Money meant to help poor residents was used to buy luxury cars, sponsor a college baseball tournament and hire family members of a top state official, according to a report from State Auditor Shad White.The 104-page audit of the Mississippi Department of Human Services released Monday shows how federal welfare grant funds flowed from DHS into two nonprofit groups, which allegedly spent the cash in inappropriate or questionable ways. More than $94 million in welfare money spending was "questioned" by auditors, according to the report – alleging either outright misspending or lack of documentation showing it was spent properly. In a statement, White said the report "shows the most egregious misspending my staff have seen in their careers at the Office of the State Auditor." He said, "If there was a way to misspend money, it seems DHS leadership or their grantees thought of it and tried it."USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Americans overwhelmingly support vote-by-mail push, but Republicans more warySecretary of Senate: Biden records can't be disclosedThe routine annual audit, which focused on fiscal year 2019, follows criminal indictments this year related to the welfare spending. White called that case Mississippi's largest embezzlement scandal, involving about $4 million in welfare money known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF. Those facing criminal charges include former Department of Human Services Director John Davis, as well as Nancy New, the leader of the Mississippi Community Education Center, or MCEC, one of the nonprofit groups that received millions of TANF dollars. The USA TODAY Network's Mississippi Clarion Ledger and other outlets reported on issues at the state's human services department and potential misspending by MCEC for months. The extent of misspending and lack of controls detailed in Monday's audit was not previously known. The audit shows for the first time how a second nonprofit group, the Family Resource Center of North Mississippi, or FRC, allegedly made many questionable or inappropriate expenditures using welfare cash. According to the audit, the spending was possible because Davis limited outside monitoring of the welfare grants. Auditors said they found forged documents, a limited or nonexistent process for vetting contracts, fraudulent accounting and more.White said his office will forward the findings to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the welfare program. Depending on what the feds view as misspending, White said, this could lead to cuts in TANF allotments or other sanctions placed on the state. Among the audit's "questioned" spending:The two nonprofit groups used welfare money to hire lobbyists, often without paperwork describing the work they were supposed to do.MCEC gave contracts to, and hired, family members of Davis, sometimes making lump sum payments. The payments and salaries to his nephew and brother-in-law totaled more than $1 million over the past several years, auditors said. Both nonprofit groups gave welfare money to a trio of wrestlers, Ted DiBiase, Ted DiBiase, Jr. and Brett DiBiase – some of it for work never performed, some for "unreasonable" travel costs. MCEC paid Victory Sports Foundation with welfare money to run fitness programs, some of which Mississippi legislators and other officials or staffers participated in, free of charge. The trainer who runs Victory, said he did not know he received welfare money. MCEC bought three cars with welfare money, each worth more than $50,000, for New and two sons. Salaries, cellphones and other expenses were paid using welfare money. The vehicles included a 2018 Nissan Armada, a Chevrolet Silverado and a Ford F-250. In each case, the vehicle was registered to MCEC, but in each case, auditors said the vehicles were for personal use. MCEC used welfare money for sports-related purposes, including sponsoring a college baseball tournament and other NCAA events. MCEC cut a $3,000 check to a bookkeeper of MCEC, though a handwritten note says "$3,000 cash was given to" Davis, the DHS executive director. MCEC moved $6 million to a private school and organization run by New and bought supplies for the school. DHS officials were scheduled to respond to the report Monday afternoon at a news conference. The directors of MCEC and FRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. Neither did attorneys for New and Davis. White said additional indictments could come in the separate criminal case. Federal investigators, including the FBI, are involved. “This audit should be a wake-up call to everyone in government," White said. "The old way of doing things, where you do whatever your boss or a person who controls a lot of money tells you to do, or you ignore the law around how to spend money because you think no one is looking – those days are over."

Earlier this year, Google revealed that all Nest accounts will require extra sign-in security starting this spring. For those who haven’t enabled phone—based two factor authentication or have migrated to a Google account yet, that means having to verify their identities via email-based authentication every time they log in. Now, the tech giant has announced that it will begin enforcing that extra security measure for its Nest products starting this month.Users will soon receive an email from accounts@nest.com with a six digit code whenever they log in to verify that they truly own the account they’re trying to access. The only way users can avoid email verification — in case it’s too much of a hassle to check for an email every log in — is to activate two-factor using their phone numbers or to migrate to a Google account. The company says it will notify users before making the security change. For now, it’s advising Nest owners to ensure they still have access to the email they use for Nest.

Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., had asked Ratcliffe about President Trump's allegation that members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies had sought to "undermine his administration.""President Trump has repeatedly, and without any basis in my view, accused the hardworking men and women of the IC [intelligence community] of working to undermine his administration," Heinrich told Ratcliffe before asking, "Do you think -- do you believe that there is 'deep state' in the IC?""I don't know what that means ... I don't know what that is," Ratcliffe responded. Heinrich followed by asking whether it would be inappropriate or illegal to "remove, or reassign, [or] to screen or otherwise discriminate against career IC personnel for political reasons.""Yes," Ratcliffe responded.FBI DISCUSSED INTERVIEWING MICHAEL FLYNN 'TO GET HIM TO LIE' AND 'GET HIM FIRED,' HANDWRITTEN NOTES SHOWRatcliffe's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly denounced the "deep state" during his term of office and accused members of law enforcement and the intelligence community of harboring bias towards him and his administration.The issue came up again last week when internal FBI documents showed top bureau officials openly questioned whether their goal in interviewing then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in January 2017 was "to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired."The documents fueled suspicions that the Russia investigation was tainted by political motives and put the spotlight back on top FBI conterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was one of the agents who interviewed Flynn. Strzok and his mistress, Lisa Page, created a media firestorm when they were removed from the FBI's Russia investigation after it was revealed that their text messages included disparaging comments about Trump.
