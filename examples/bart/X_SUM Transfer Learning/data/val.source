Worshipers at one of Seoul’s largest Catholic churches must refrain from singing hymns or saying “amen” for fear of spreading saliva. Priests sanitize their hands during communion. Holy water has been removed from the chapel.“This should become the new normal from now on,” said Gong Mi-young, 53, who owns a tutoring school and attended Mass one night this week at Myeongdong Church in the South Korean capital. “We have to be ready for war.”South Korea even has a name for the new practices: “everyday life quarantine.” The authorities recently released a 68-page guide, offering advice on situations like going to the movies (“refrain from shouting”) and attending funerals (“bow your head instead of hugging”).As cities in Asia, Australia and elsewhere get their coronavirus outbreaks under control, churches, schools, restaurants, movie theaters and even sporting venues are starting to open, creating a sense of normalcy for people who have spent weeks and even months in isolation.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut they are returning to a world reimagined for the age of coronavirus, where social distancing, hygiene standards and government-imposed restrictions are infused into nearly every activity — a way of life that is likely to persist until a vaccine or a treatment is found.In Hong Kong, tables at restaurants must be spaced at least five feet apart and customers are given bags to store their face masks during dining.In China, students face temperature checks before they can enter schools, while cafeteria tables are outfitted with plastic dividers.In South Korea, baseball games are devoid of fans and players can’t spit on the field.Many people say they have no choice but to embrace the changes, even as they come to terms with the loss of freedom and spontaneity. At the Salsa Amigos dance club in Seoul, teachers are instructing students to wear masks, take frequent breaks so they don’t sweat and keep a distance of roughly three feet from their partners. Some instructors are avoiding dance routines for couples over worries that students will have too much contact. “I really wish the virus would just go away so I can dance again,” said Woo Tae-hyuck, 48, an employee at a telecom company who attended salsa and bachata lessons this week.The new social customs and mandates in Beijing, Hong Kong and Seoul, as well as Sydney, Australia, and Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, offer a preview of what might soon be common globally. While parts of Europe and the United States are taking tentative steps to loosen restrictions, many cities in Asia and Australia are further along.The coronavirus, or the fear of its spread, arrived earlier in such places, and they have already waged monthslong efforts to mitigate transmission. With new cases at or approaching zero, they now have the confidence to begin opening up — albeit cautiously.Popular tourist sites in China, where the outbreak began in December, are once again accepting visitors, though with strict limits on crowd sizes. The Forbidden City in Beijing is allowing only 5,000 people to visit per day, compared with 80,000 before the outbreak.Libraries in Hong Kong are reopening, but visitors are allowed to be inside for only an hour at a time.Hair salons in Sydney, some of which had closed because of the virus or financial pressures, are back in business with abundant supplies of masks and hand sanitizer. At some, magazines are no longer handed out to customers.Governments are trying to keep the virus at bay while allowing enough room for economic and social activity to pick up again. Officials are testing new sanitation and social-distancing guidelines, like requiring masks on trains and buses and advising the public to avoid face-to-face interactions at work. There are mandatory temperature checks outside restaurants and malls.Some governments are imposing limits on how many people can gather. In Sydney, residents can only host two visitors at a time in their homes, while officials in Hong Kong have prohibited more than four people from being together in a public place. Outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people are discouraged in Taiwan.Churches were a particular focus in South Korea, where the outbreak was tied to a secretive religious sect. Many now require worshipers to book spots at services in advance to limit the number of people, and those who attend must wear masks.Schools represent one of the biggest challenges for governments. Classrooms are notorious as hotbeds of germs and social interactions. But societies won’t be able to truly function until parents can send their children to school full-time.In Sydney, schools are reopening in phases, holding classes one day a week for a quarter of the students from each grade and gradually expanding until the end of June. In Beijing, seniors preparing for college entrance exams are returning, while in Shanghai students in their last year of high school and middle school are doing so as well. Seoul is making plans to head back soon.But educators are not taking chances.In the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, a private elementary school asked students to make hats with three-foot long cardboard wings when classes resumed in late April to learn about social distancing. As they showed off their hats, they answered questions from teachers about the incubation period of the coronavirus and its symptoms.In Taiwan, where classes have been in session since late February, schools have canceled assemblies and ordered students to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. They have asked students to refrain from speaking while they eat and discouraged popular games like Jenga that bring students elbow to elbow. Graduation ceremonies at many schools are moving online.“There are many things I miss, but it’s necessary to fight this disease,” said Lee Yu Cheng, 18, a student at Taipei Municipal Yucheng High School. “If I get infected, what about my family?”Businesses are also taking extra precautions to draw wary customers who have grown accustomed to staying at home.Black Sheep, an upscale restaurant group in Hong Kong, has made temperature checks and surveys about medical history mandatory at its 23 restaurants. Alcohol spray and disposable bags for storing masks are at every table. Black Sheep’s leaders say the measures have helped its image and its business.“A lot of things are not going to return to what they were pre-Covid anytime soon,” said Syed Asim Hussain, a co-founder of Black Sheep. “Old standards are not good enough. Physical distancing is one thing that is definitely here to stay.”Technology is also helping governments and businesses adjust and adapt to the ongoing threat of the virus.At some movie theaters in Seoul, robots have been deployed to offer customers details on schedules and the location of restrooms. Snacks are distributed through an automated kiosk rather than by staff.In China, officials are using apps to track the health and travel history of residents, requiring them to show QR codes to gain entry to restaurants, office buildings and apartment complexes. Zeng Leyi, a designer in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city, said the measures, including temperature checks at restaurants, gave her peace of mind.“I’m so afraid of death that if they don’t take my temperature, I won’t dare go inside,” said Ms. Zeng, 25.There are few signs that life will truly return to normal anytime soon, even in countries where new coronavirus infections have fallen significantly.Concert halls are silent. Subway cars are sparsely populated. Sports teams in South Korea and Taiwan play in empty stadiums.To combat the sense of isolation, baseball teams in Taiwan are filling the bleachers with cardboard cutouts and mannequins. Some are using robots to belt out music from the stands.In Sydney, beaches have started to reopen, but police officers and lifeguards patrol regularly to ensure that swimmers use the waters only for exercise and do not linger. Paddling, sunbathing and water games are prohibited.The rules have not dampened the spirit of many residents, who say they are relieved to get out of the house again after weeks of lockdown.Desmond Cohn, 26, ducked into the waters at Bondi Beach in Sydney this week. The beaches provide an “emotional outlet” for many residents, he said, and many are eager to reconnect with nature.“Everyone was sort of smiling at each other, looking around,” he said. “We’re all thinking, how bloody good is this? About time.”
The coronavirus pandemic may last until 2022, according to a report published Thursday.A group of researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak won't end until 60% to 70% of the human population is immune to the virus, which may take between 18 and 24 months.The experts laid out three scenarios for how the coronavirus pandemic will progress. The worst-case scenario among these three projections involves a second, larger wave of infections this fall and winter. The report authors suggest this is the most likely outcome, and states need to prepare for it."This thing's not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70% of people," Michael Osterholm, report author and the director of CIDRAP, told CNN. "The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology." Osterholm and his colleagues examined multiple models that predict future coronavirus impacts, research about how well COVID-19 spreads between people, and data from past pandemics to reach their conclusions.The coronavirus outbreak shares important similarities to a pandemic influenza, like the 1918 Spanish flu (which infected 500 million people worldwide), which makes this type of flu a solid model for comparison. Both a pandemic influenza and the COVID-19 virus spread via droplets we emit when coughing or sneezing and can pass between infected people showing no symptoms — known as asymptomatic carriers. But even though pandemic influenza may be a good model to try and predict how the COVID-19 will outbreak will play out, experts still aren't sure what to expect.That's because the coronavirus spreads even more easily than the flu does. An average person with the coronavirus infects between 2 and 2.5 new people, this metric is known as the virus' R0 value. Seasonal influenza's Ro value is about 1.3. "There is no crystal ball to tell us what the future holds and what the 'end game' for controlling this pandemic will be," the report authors wrote.That's why Osterholm's group came up with three possible scenarios about what might be coming after this first wave of coronavirus infections ends.Scenario 1: The summer months and beyond bring a series of repetitive, smaller wavesIn this projection, the first COVID-19 wave is followed by a series of repetitive, smaller waves that occur through the summer and beyond. Those waves, which will come with a lower number of infections than the world is experiencing right now, will persist over a one- to two-year period. They'll gradually diminishing sometime in 2022.The authors noted that where those smaller waves occur could depend on what measures certain geographic areas have in place to "flatten the curve," including social distancing and non-essential business closures, and how those measures are rolled back. Scenario 2: A second, larger wave of infections hits this fall and winterThe worst of the three scenarios, and the most likely, is one in which the first wave is followed by a larger wave in the fall or winter of 2020, and one or more smaller subsequent waves in 2021.This mirrors what happened during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 flu.A second wave with more infections would require the US and other countries to reinstitute mitigation measures, like lockdowns, the authors wrote. "States, territories, and tribal health authorities should plan for the worst-case scenario," they added.Scenario 3: The world experiences a 'slow burn' of ongoing transmissionThe final scenario suggests that this first wave of coronavirus infections is the only wave. In the coming months, the COVID-19 pandemic would shift into a "slow burn" of ongoing transmission and new cases."While this third pattern was not seen with past influenza pandemics, it remains a possibility for COVID-19," the experts reported.This possibility would mean US states likely wouldn't need to lockdown again, although cases and deaths would continue to occur.Each of these projections could be influenced by the development of a vaccine. But any help a vaccine could provide during the pandemic will be a long time coming, the report authors said. The earliest a vaccine is expected is 2021. "And we don't know what kinds of challenges could arise during vaccine development that could delay the timeline," they added. 
Households have been told to brace themselves for the worst recession in living memory as the brutal impact of Covid-19 becomes clearer.With Prime Minister Boris Johnson preparing to lay out plans to get people back to work, details of the damage already inflicted by the lockdown on vast swathes of the economy have emerged.A closely watched survey revealed the UK's dominant services sector, which encompasses everything from restaurants and hotels to airlines, contracted at the fastest pace on record last month.The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services – where anything below 50 represents decline – dropped to 13.4 in April.This is by far the worst score since the survey started in 1996, and well below the 40.1 recorded in the depths of the financial crisis in November 2008.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: 'The downturn in the UK during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.'It is feared economic output could fall by as much as 35 per cent in the current second quarter of the year.The damage inflicted on Britain's once booming motor industry also became clearer, as figures showed just 4,321 new cars were sold in April.That was down 97 per cent on a year earlier and the lowest number since 1946, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The lockdown has led to car showrooms and factories being closed and many customers being housebound.The brutal impact of the pandemic means the auto industry is on course for its worst year since 1992, when the UK economy was in recession.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: 'The market's worst performance in living memory is hardly surprising.'These figures, however, still make for exceptionally grim reading, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the sector.'The lockdown enforced on March 23 has helped to stop the spread of the deadly Covid-19 but has paralysed large swathes of the economy and put vast numbers of companies on the brink.One in ten firms – some 591,000 businesses – are at high risk of going bust as a result of the pandemic, according to analysis published today.The report, by the CEBR thinktank and polling company Opinium, also warned more than a quarter of a million firms will not survive if the lockdown lasts for another month.But it warned a second wave of infections and a subsequent lockdown 'could prove fatal for the business community'.Based on a poll of more than 500 firms, it predicted 1.1m companies could not survive another three months of lockdown. Pablo Shah, senior economist at CEBR, said that the findings 'provide the first glimpse of the deep and long-term scars that the coronavirus crisis is set to inflict upon the UK economy'.And a hard-hitting report by the Resolution Foundation warned youth unemployment could rise by 600,000 this year and 'scar' the long-term prospects of a generation. It predicted the figure could top one million, more than doubling the current level of 408,000.With around 800,000 people aged between 18 and 24 set to leave education this year, the report warned the 'corona class of 2020' could face years of reduced pay and limited prospects.But it also warned that younger people who have just joined the workforce, including recent graduates, are more likely to be made redundant as many firms adopt a 'last in, first out' policy.

The availability of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus will likely play a key role in determining when Americans can return to life as usual. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on April 30 announced that a vaccine could even be available by January 2021.Whether a vaccine can end this pandemic successfully, however, depends on more than its effectiveness at providing immunity against the virus, or how quickly it can be produced in mass quantities. Americans also must choose to receive the vaccine.According to some estimates, 50% to 70% of Americans would need to develop immunity to COVID-19 – either naturally, or via a vaccine – in order to thwart the spread of the virus. If these estimates are correct, that could mean that nearly twice as many Americans would need to elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccine than those who currently opt to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Just 37% of American adults did so in 2017-2018, even in the midst of a historically severe flu season.Making matters more complicated is the possibility that people who hold skeptical views about vaccine safety – sometimes referred to as “anti-vaxxers” – will not opt to receive the coronavirus vaccine. According to some estimates, about one fifth to two fifths of Americans express reservations about vaccine safety. If most of these individuals forego receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, they could potentially jeopardize the recovery process.One of us is a doctoral candidate, and the other is a professor, who both study vaccine resistance. We conducted a study, which is currently undergoing peer review, where we estimate the number of Americans who report being willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, once it becomes available. We also investigate the reasons some Americans might refuse the vaccine.We found that about one fifth of Americans, and more than half of people who hold skeptical views toward vaccine safety, may be unwilling to pursue vaccination. Although most Americans do plan to get vaccinated, non-compliance rates may be high enough to pose a threat to collective immunity.Is coronavirus changing minds about vaccine safety?On the one hand, a pandemic may be encouraging anti-vaxxers to change their minds. One reason so many Americans doubt vaccine safety is due to complacency – the idea that, because high rates of vaccine compliance have kept us safe from diseases that once reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., segments of the population can hold anti-vaccine views without endangering public health. Consistent with this view, research finds that when people are concerned that once nearly eradicated diseases might re-emerge to reach epidemic levels, people are more likely to trust recommendations from public health experts. Additionally,cross-national survey research suggests that people who live in parts of the world where the threat of epidemics are more likely tend to hold more positive views toward vaccines than the rest of the world.Studies based on in-depth interviews with parents further suggest that parents who chose not to vaccinate their children are often willing to accept treatments for children with life-threatening illnesses.On the other hand, however, it could be the case that anti-vaxxers remain suspicious of a COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available. Prominent anti-vaccine websites have already begun circulating misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine – such as the idea that a vaccine has existed for years and has been kept from public consumption. Additionally, recent research suggests that anti-vaccine views are tied to deeply held psychological and moral aversions to inoculation, implying that attitudes may be difficult to change.What do anti-vaxxers say now?We set out to investigate this important question. In a demographically representative survey of 493 U.S. adults conducted on April 15, 2020, we investigated whether people who hold skeptical views toward vaccine safety plan to receive a vaccine against COVID-19.Specifically, we asked respondents whether they would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 once a vaccine becomes available. Nearly a quarter (23%) of respondents said that they would not.Additionally, and consistent with the view that even a global pandemic may not persuade anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated, we find that 62% of people who are skeptical of vaccines said that they will forego COVID-19 vaccination.To assess this, we measured vaccine skepticism by asking respondents three questions about whether they find vaccines to be safe, effective, and/or important – which is how vaccine skepticism is typically measured. Respondents indicated whether they thought each characteristic described vaccines “quite a bit,” “a moderate amount,” “a little bit,” or “not at all.” We then averaged the score across the three to create a scale of vaccine skepticism.Nearly one-fifth (19%) of respondents were more vaccine skeptical than not. Among vaccine skeptics, 62% stated that they would not get vaccinated against COVID-19. By contrast, just 15% of those more supportive of vaccines than skeptical said that they would not get the COVID-19 vaccine.We also asked respondents if they self-identified as anti-vaxxers, and nearly 16% said they did. For those that identified as anti-vaxxers, 44% said they would not vaccinate against COVID-19, compared to 19% of people who did not identify as anti-vaxxers.A threat to collective immunity?We believe that these findings, although preliminary, suggest that many people who hold anti-vaccine beliefs may jeopardize the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine once it’s available, due to issues of non-compliance. Furthermore, it appears that anti-vaccine sentiment is at least as widespread as it was before the pandemic began.We caution that a drawback of this study is that it doesn’t directly measure changes in vaccine sentiment over time. However, the levels of anti-vaccine sentiment found in this data are comparable to similar levels of anti-vaccine sentiment in the American public before the pandemic, according to previous studies. Tracking public attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccine can help public health agencies better understand who plans to receive the vaccine, and why some people might choose to refuse it. 
This year's summer series of Love Island has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, bosses have confirmed.ITV says the show will come back in 2021.The announcement has been made after much speculation about how the hit reality series, which usually airs in the UK in June, would go ahead due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Last week, ITV boss Kevin Lygo said he had ruled out filming in the UK rather than Majorca, after considering whether it could take place in Cornwall, and that he felt "uneasy" about airing a show that sees people "slathering over each other" while the rest of the nation is being told to socially distance.Now, it has been officially called off."We have tried every which way to make Love Island this summer but logistically it's just not possible to produce it in a way that safeguards the well-being of everyone involved and that for us is the priority," Mr Lygo said."In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Majorca to get the villa ready but clearly that's now out of the question."We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021."Host Laura Whitmore, who took over presenting duties from Caroline Flack for the first winter series earlier this year, said this year's series, set to be the seventh, had received more applications than ever."Like with a lot of things because of restrictions with travel, social distancing and unable to plan ahead, Love Island is postponed until 2021," she tweeted."Great news is that there have been more applications than any other series!"Next year is going to be BIG. Stay safe."Love Island has been a huge hit for ITV2 since its relaunch in 2015, and the first winter series, which was filmed in South Africa, launched in January.Whitmore had been confirmed as host for the winter show after Flack was charged with assault in December 2019.Flack later took her own life on 15 February, at the age of 40, just a few weeks before her trial was due to take place.Love Island paid tribute during the final episode of the latest series, which was won by Paige Turley and Finn Tapp.An inquest into her death is due to resume on 5 August.

Dark matter has so far defied every type of detector designed to find it. Because of its huge gravitational footprint in space, we know dark matter must make up about 85 percent of the total mass of the universe, but we don't yet know what it's made of.Several large experiments that hunt for dark matter have searched for signs of dark matter particles knocking into atomic nuclei via a process known as scattering, which can produce tiny flashes of light and other signals in these interactions.Now a new study, led by researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley, suggests new paths for catching the signals of dark matter particles that have their energy absorbed by these nuclei.The absorption process could give an affected atom a kick that causes it to eject a lighter, energized particle such as an electron, and it might produce other types of signals, too, depending on the nature of the dark matter particle.The study focuses mostly on those cases where an electron or neutrino is ejected as the dark matter particle strikes an atom's nucleus.Published May 4 in Physical Review Letters, the study proposes that some existing experiments, including ones that search for dark matter particles and processes related to neutrinos—ghostly, detectable particles that can pass through most matter and have the ability to change into different forms—can easily be broadened to also look for these absorption-related types of telltale dark matter signals.Also, the researchers propose that new searches in previously collected particle detector data could possibly turn up these overlooked dark matter signals."In this field, we've had a certain idea in mind about well-motivated candidates for dark matter, such as the WIMP," or weakly interacting massive particle, said Jeff Dror, the lead author of the study who is a postdoctoral researcher in Berkeley Lab's Theory Group and UC Berkeley's Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics.Dark matter pushes at the boundaries of the known fundamental laws of physics, encapsulated in the Standard Model of particle physics, and "The WIMP paradigm is very easy to build into the Standard Model, but we haven't found it for a long time," Dror noted.So, physicists are now considering other places that dark matter particles may be hiding, and other particle possibilities such as theorized "sterile neutrinos" that could also be brought into the family of particles known as fermions—which includes electrons, protons, and neutrinos."It's easy, with small modifications to the WIMP paradigm, to accommodate a whole different type of signal," Dror said. "You can make a huge amount of progress with very little cost if you step back a little bit in the way we've been thinking about dark matter."Robert McGehee, a UC Berkeley graduate student, and Gilly Elor of the University of Washington were study co-authors. The researchers note that the range of new signals they are focusing on opens up an "ocean" of dark matter particle possibilities: namely as-yet-undiscovered fermions with masses lighter than the typical range considered for WIMPs. They could be close cousins of sterile neutrinos, for example.The study team considered absorption processes known as "neutral current," in which nuclei in the detector material recoil, or get jolted by their collision with dark matter particles, producing distinct energy signatures that can be picked up by the detector; and also those known as "charged current," which can produce multiple signals as a dark matter particle strikes a nucleus, causing a recoil and the ejection of an electron.The charge current process can also involve nuclear decay, in which other particles are ejected from a nucleus as a sort of domino effect triggered by the dark matter absorption.Looking for the study's suggested signatures of both the neutral current and charge current processes could open up "orders of magnitude of unexplored parameter space," the researchers note. They focus on energy signals in the MeV, which means millions of electron volts. An electron volt is a measure of energy that physicists use to describe the masses of particles. Meanwhile, typical WIMP searches are now sensitive to particle interactions with energies in the keV range, or thousands of electron volts.For the various particle interactions the researchers explored in the study, "You can predict what is the energy spectrum of the particle coming out or the nucleon that's getting the 'kick,'" Dror said. Nucleon refers to the positively charged proton or uncharged neutron that resides in an atom's nucleus and that could absorb energy when struck by a dark matter particle. These absorption signals could possibly be more common than the other types of signals that dark matter detectors are typically designed to find, he added—we just don't know yet.Experiments that have large volumes of detector material, with high sensitivity and very low background "noise," or unwanted interference from other types of particle signals, are particularly suited for this expanded search for different types of dark matter signals, Dror said.LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), for example, an ultrasensitive Berkeley Lab-led dark matter search project under construction in a former South Dakota mine, is a possible candidate as it will use about 10 metric tons of liquid xenon as its detector medium and is designed to be heavily shielded from other types of particle noise.Already, the team of researchers participating in the study has worked with the team operating the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO), an underground experiment searching for a theorized process known as neutrino-less double beta decay using liquid xenon, to open up its search to these other types of dark matter signals.And for similar types of experiments that are up and running, "The data is already basically sitting there. It's just a matter of looking at it," Dror said.The researchers name a laundry list of candidate experiments around the world that could have relevant data and search capabilities that could be used to find their target signals, including: CUORE, LZ predecessor LUX, PandaX-II, XENON1T, KamLAND-Zen, SuperKamiokande, CDMS-II, DarkSide-50, and Borexino among them.As a next step, the research team is hoping to work with experiment collaborations to analyze existing data, and to find out whether search parameters of active experiments can be adjusted to search for other signals."I think the community is starting to become fairly aware of this," Dror said, adding, "One of the biggest questions in the field is the nature of dark matter. We don't know what it is made out of, but answering these questions could be within our reach in the near future. For me, that's a huge motivation to keep pushing—there is new physics out there."

SEOUL, South Korea -- Cheerleaders danced beneath rows of empty seats, and umpires wore protective masks as a new Korea Baseball Organization season began in South Korea.After a weekslong delay because of the coronavirus pandemic, a hushed atmosphere allowed sounds, such as the ball hitting the catcher's mitt and the bat hitting the ball for a single or double, to echo around the stadium.There were faces in the stands at a game on Tuesday -- pictures placed in the seating -- because fans aren't allowed into the venues for now.As a result, it was easy to hear players cheering and shouting from the dugouts. It was a relief to fans watching from home in a country that is now attempting a slow return to pre-COVID-19 normalcy amid a waning caseload.The country's professional soccer leagues will kick off Friday, also without spectators in the stadiums.As one of the world's first major professional sports competitions to return to action amid the pandemic, the KBO League has employed preventive measures aimed at creating safe playing environments.Players and coaches go through fever screenings before entering stadiums, and umpires and first- and third-base coaches must wear masks during games. Players are prohibited from high-fiving teammates or signing autographs. Chewing tobacco was banned to prevent spitting. Masks and latex gloves are required at training facilities.Fans will be barred from games until the KBO is convinced that the risks of infection have been minimized. If any member of a team tests positive for the coronavirus at any point of the season, the league will be shut down for at least three weeks.On Tuesday, teams tried to create a festive atmosphere in the empty stadiums.In a game in the capital, Seoul-based LG Twins defeated crosstown rival and defending champion Doosan Bears 8-2 at Jamsil Baseball Stadium, where the outfield seats were decked with huge banners of the Twins' cheering slogans.Twins outfielder Kim Hyun-soo, who spent some time with the Baltimore Orioles, hit the league's first home run of the season in the third inning, a two-run shot off Bears starter Raul Alcantara. As he rounded the bases, Kim extended a hand toward third-base coach Kim Jea-gul, who raised his arm but stayed out of contact."The players just really wanted to play baseball, and we are delighted to do just that," Kim Hyun-soo said.In Incheon, SK Wyverns imitated a home crowd by covering the outfield seats with rows of horizontal banners showing faces of fans wearing Wyverns caps and masks as they hosted the Daejeon-based Hanwha Eagles.In Daegu, the city hit the worst by the virus, the home team Samsung Lions used their huge scoreboard to play video messages from players, celebrities and fans thanking doctors and medical staff fighting the outbreak, which overwhelmed the city's hospital capacities in late February and March before slowing in recent weeks. The Lions' game against the Changwon-based NC Dinos was broadcast on ESPN. The NC Dinos won 4-0."It would have been better if they could be with us, but I am glad that we delivered something good to fans watching TV," said Dinos outfielder Na Sung-bum, who went 2-for-3.Also, the Seoul-based Kiwoom Heroes routed the host Kia Tigers 11-2 in Gwangju, handing former San Francisco Giants slugger Matt Williams his first loss as a manager in the KBO. The Busan-based Lotte Giants defeated the KT Wiz 7-2 on the road in Suwon.A full season of baseball seemed doubtful in early March, when South Korea was reporting around 500 new coronavirus cases per day, forcing the KBO to postpone its March 28 season openers.But South Korea reported just three new cases on Tuesday, its lowest daily jump since infections surged in late February. Experts credit the downward trend to tightened border controls and active efforts to test and isolate virus carriers and trace their contacts, using medical, banking and immigration records and location information provided by police and telecommunications companies.Officials have started relaxing social-distancing guidelines and are preparing to reopen schools, starting with high school seniors on May 13.Barring any virus-related suspensions, the KBO plans to maintain a 144-game regular-season schedule. However, it decided to scrap its all-star game and shorten the first round of the playoffs from best-of-five to best-of-three series.  
Just when you thought 2020 could not get any worse. Now we have giant hornets with freakish eyes and a venomous sting to add to this year's long list of worries.For the first time, Asian giant hornets have been spotted in the United States, specifically in Washington state, scientists say. Beekeepers have reported piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off, an alarming sight in a country with a rapidly declining bee population.At more than two inches long, they're the world's largest hornets with a sting that can kill humans if stung multiple times, according to experts at the Washington State University. The giant insects are nicknamed "murder hornets.""They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face," Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at the Washington State University's department of entomology, said recently.A size comparison of the Asian giant hornet and several other insectsHow did they come to the US?Scientists don't know how these giant hornets native to Asia ended up in Washington state.They can sometimes be transported in international cargo, according to Seth Truscott with WSU's college of agricultural, human and natural resource sciences.The giant hornet was first spotted in the state in December, and scientists believe it started becoming active again last month, when queens emerge from hibernation to build nests and form colonies."Hornets are most destructive in the late summer and early fall, when they are on the hunt for sources of protein to raise next year's queens," Truscott said on the WSU's Insider."They attack honey bee hives, killing adult bees and devouring bee larvae and pupae, while aggressively defending the occupied colony," he added. "Their stings are big and painful, with a potent neurotoxin. Multiple stings can kill humans, even if they are not allergic."What should you do if you spot one?Washington state agricultural officials are asking beekeepers and residents to report any sightings of the giant hornets. But don't get too close. Its sting can penetrate a regular beekeeper's suit, and state scientists had to order special reinforced suits."Don't try to take them out yourself if you see them," said entomologist Chris Looney of the state Department of Agriculture. "If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we're going to have any hope of eradication."State officials are asking people in Whatcom, Skagit, Island, San Juan, Jefferson and Clallam counties to be especially vigilant.When are they most destructive?The giant hornets especially target bees between late summer and the fall."The most likely time to catch Asian giant hornets is from July through October -- when colonies are established and workers are out foraging," the Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a statement. "Traps can be hung as early as April if attempting to trap queens, but since there are significantly fewer queens than workers, catching a queen isn't very likely."State officials set up traps and launched an app to quickly report sightings, saying just a few of the hornets can devastate a hive within hours.Bees pollinate plants producing fruit, nuts and vegetables, and are crucial to the nation's food industry. Attack by the hornets risks decimating bees, which are already on endangered lists due to their sharply declining numbers. 
A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said.This means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought.Dr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19.The patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad.Knowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread.The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak.The French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary.France is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago, a post-mortem examination carried out in California revealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought.What do we know about the new case?Dr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris.He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear.The patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus.This was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Mr Hammar told French broadcaster BFMTV that he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms.But Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that "often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases"."We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic," Dr Cohen said.What does it tell us?Could coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas.How does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing.But it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan.Certainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease.Why does it matter?Until now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member.Mr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier.The first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January.Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere."It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short," Prof Kao said. How was the new case found?Dr Cohen told the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January.He found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19.He said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19.A full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added.

Top US health official Anthony Fauci  has said that there is no scientific evidence to support claims by Donald Trump that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab. Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been one of the leading medical experts helping to guide the US response to the highly contagious virus that has swept across the country.Dr Fauci contradicted claims made by the US president that the global coronavirus pandemic started in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan in an interview published on Monday evening by National Geographic. "If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, (the scientific evidence) is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated," Fauci told the magazine."Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that (this virus) evolved in nature and then jumped species," he said.The well-regarded doctor has at times corrected or contradicted the president at White House briefings or in press interviews on issues such as the time required to develop a vaccine and the likelihood that the coronavirus will return in the fall.The World Health Organization also said on Monday that Washington had provided nothing to support "speculative" claims that a Wuhan lab was to blame for the outbreak."We have not received any data or specific evidence from the United States government relating to the purported origin of the virus - so from our perspective, this remains speculative," WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual briefing.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also said in comments on Tuesday that the most likely origin of the virus was a Chinese wet market, appearing to contradict Trump's claims.Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.Mr Trump, increasingly critical of China's management of the outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory.And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said "enormous evidence" backed up that claim, although the US intelligence community last week said it would continue to study whether the outbreak stemmed from infected animal contact, or a lab accident.China has vehemently denied suggestions the lab was the source."Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus," Mr Ryan said, stressing that this was a very important piece of public health information for future control."If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard," he added. 
President Donald Trump's demands for the next coronavirus aid package are running into a stubborn obstacle: his own party.Asked what he thought of a payroll tax cut, the subject of Trump's ultimatum for any new bill, Sen. Chuck Grassley didn't hesitate."Right now, not much," the Senate Finance Committee chairman said, worrying that the tax cut could drain retirement funds or leave older Americans with the view that Congress doesn’t take “seriously” the plight of the Social Security Trust Fund.“I’m going to give it due consideration, if I can see a strong group of people who think it’s the right thing to do,” added Grassley (R-Iowa), whose committee handles federal tax policy. But he said the president’s preference wouldn’t be the last word — a sentiment shared by many in the Senate GOP: “The president proposes, we dispose.”As Washington begins zeroing in on its next major coronavirus bill, congressional Republicans are on a different trajectory than the president and are themselves divided on the payroll tax cut, or whether to do anything at all. Much of the party has coalesced behind providing liability protections that Democrats disdain, yet Trump is eyeing the much flashier tax cut as the centerpiece of the upcoming legislation. Meanwhile, House Democrats are moving ahead with their own big relief bill that Republicans are certain to reject.A divided GOP combined with a partisan House Democratic plan and a president with his own goals is a formula for deeply complicated negotiations and an uncertain outlook, even as millions are losing their jobs and the Paycheck Protection Program threatens to run out of money for the second time since its inception.Republicans are taking it slow on the next round of talks, but they’ve already made a clear ask of their Democratic counterparts: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has spent the past week touting his insistence that new legislation relax liabilities for businesses and employees that get back to work amid the pandemic.It seems highly unlikely Republicans can draw red lines on both McConnell’s liability protections and the president’s payroll tax cut in exchange for reaching an agreement with Democrats to provide billions more to ailing state and local governments.“They’ve got to get their act together,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).While there’s plenty of GOP support for the liability provisions, the president’s beloved tax cut is another story. Republicans are not universally in favor of it. And McConnell hates dividing his conference because it weakens his negotiating hand.When asked about Trump's demand on payroll taxes on Tuesday, McConnell said "if there's any red line, it's on litigation." And in interviews with a series of Republicans on Tuesday it was clear why McConnell was focusing on the liability angle rather than the payroll tax cut.Sen. John Thune of South Dakota (R-S.D.), McConnell’s top deputy, said that protecting employers and employees from lawsuits is “straightforward.” But when asked about the payroll tax cut, he replied: “I’m not a particular fan of that.”“I guess I’m open to being persuaded that it’s something that could be effective. But I think some of the things we’re currently doing are having a bigger impact,” he said, listing aid programs for small businesses and direct payments to the public. “The payroll tax cut only helps if you’re on the payroll.”Congress in March deferred employers' payroll taxes for the year. But Trump has been explicit that more needs to be done for workers.“We’re not doing anything without a payroll tax cut,” Trump told Fox News over the weekend. On Tuesday, he re-upped that demand, adding in that he wants to eliminate sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants and “perhaps” cutting capital gains taxes as well.A White House official said the president is “passionate” about the idea of a payroll tax cut as one that gives workers more buying power and helps businesses more easily staff up moving forward. After failing to secure it in previous aid bills, Trump may be even more determined this time around.“It should be on the table. The president supports it. You shore up the trust fund with a transfer,” agreed Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). "This is a way to get more dollars into the hands of employees as well as employers.”Democrats are averse to both the payroll tax cut and the liability reform. Asked about Trump’s declaration on the payroll tax during a Monday appearance on CNN, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said “no way” and that drawing a line in the sand was counterproductive. But she also said she wasn't going to negotiate in the press.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said on Tuesday that it would be a “serious mistake” to embrace shielding companies from coronavirus lawsuits and that he would not rule out the payroll tax. But he also made clear that Democrats are “of the impression that Nancy Pelosi has the lead on the negotiation.”Some Republicans said the war of words between Pelosi and Trump was all part of the dance.“I heard the speaker say ‘no way’ and the president said he wouldn't sign a bill without it. So it sounds like the beginning of a negotiation,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Still, he added that while there would be debate about the payroll tax cut, liability reform was an “imperative.”Yet having two starkly different messages from the White House and Republicans in Congress often undercuts the GOP’s negotiating stance. And if Trump wants to win over his party he's got work to do, even among strong allies.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is close to the president, said he agreed with McConnell's focus on liability protections and that while he liked the idea of cutting taxes, it weighed on him to draw down the Social Security accounts. Maybe, he said, the best thing for Congress to do is nothing at all.“I’m not really for more stuff here. I’m here to oppose anything more coming from Washington,” Paul said. “Because there’s nothing to give.”

The ECG function of the Apple Watch has been credited with uncovering a heart condition in an 80-year-old woman in Germany, one that was seemingly missed by a hospital's own ECG during a diagnosis.The Apple Watch has repeatedly appeared in stories where it warned wearers of possible heart problems, and has been praised for being an early warning system for serious cardiovascular issues. In one recently reported case, the Apple wearable actually provided better evidence of a condition than a hospital's own equipment.In a report published in the European Heart Journal on Wednesday and spotted by 9to5Mac, an 80-year-old woman attended the University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University, Germany, with what was described as "typical angina symptoms." The patient also advised of two praesyncopy episodes, a situation where a person almost loses consciousness due to reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the brain.Based on the presented details, and the female engineer's previous diagnosis of arterial hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and having had a pulmonary embolism two years prior, doctors performed an initial 12-channel ECG. The test didn't see any evidence for ischaemia, which is a restriction in blood vessels that can restrict the blood supply.Despite the hospital's own equipment not showing ischaemia, doctors were then convinced there was a related issue by the patient complaining about earlier ectopic beat episodes, which she recorded by using the ECG function of her Apple Watch. The recordings also included tracings with marked ST-segment depression, evidence that led to the medical team omitting further diagnostic measures in favor of treatment.In effect, the Apple Watch ECG recordings showed evidence of an issue that didn't appear in the hospital's specialized equipment, and successfully convinced doctors to treat the patient.The woman was transferred to a catheterization laboratory for a "left main stem stenosis and a left anterior descending/diagonal bifurcation lesion," and treatment with coronary artery stenting. The patient left the hospital the next day.It is suggested by the report that the Apple Watch "may be used not only to detect atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular-conduction disturbances but also to detect myocardial ischaemia."Current speculation for the Apple Watch Series 6 suggests the next generation of Apple Watch may include a feature for blood oxygen detection, as well as an upgraded ECG capable of working at higher heart rate ranges than the version introduced in the Apple Watch Series 4.AppleInsider has affiliate partnerships and may earn commission on products purchased through affiliate links.

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, one of its biggest events of the year, is shifting online and will be held on June 22, amid concerns about the novel coronavirus and social distancing measures that continue to be extended throughout Silicon Valley. Apple also said that WWDC will be free for all developers to access via its developer app and website.Apple earlier announced that the event, which typically takes place in early June and reveals new software for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, would transition to being online-only as its native San Francisco Bay Area began instituting lockdowns. CNET's global team will cover WWDC, as well as other conferences that have shifted online, just as we always do -- by providing real-time updates, commentary and analysis you can only get here.Apple is just the latest in a string of companies shifting or canceling events as the coronavirus has spread around the world. The virus, for which there is no approved vaccine or cure, has killed more than 250,000 people worldwide, and infected more than 3.6 million people. Other companies like the internet giants Facebook and Google have also canceled their respective developer events, which were planned for the spring. Large organizations too have scuttled their plans, including the annual SXSW music and tech festival in Texas and the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. Even Disneyland shut down.Though Apple typically focuses on new software at its WWDC event each year, including updates to its iOS and MacOS operating systems, it does sometimes introduce devices as well. Last year, it unveiled its new $5,999 Mac Pro desktop and $4,999 Apple Pro Display XDR, aimed at professional artists, editors and coders.Apple typically sponsors over 300 students from around the world to come to California for WWDC, based on a coding contest. This year, it's doing a Swift Student Challenge instead, and the winning students will get WWDC swag.Apple's been holding WWDC at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center since 2017, which it moved to after outgrowing the space at San Francisco's Moscone West. When the company announced plans to move WWDC online-only in March, it committed $1 million to local San Jose organizations to offset revenue lost from moving to the online-only format this year.

Stargazers are in for another treat this week as the Eta Aquariids meteor shower reaches its peak.Created by the debris left behind by Halley's comet, the celestial display will come to a climax between midnight and dawn on May 5 and 6.Although it looks more spectacular in the southern hemisphere, it can still be seen in the north.It produces about 30 meteors per hour at its peak - although the light of the nearly full moon this week could obscure all but the brightest meteors.While they're commonly known as shooting stars, meteors are nothing of the sort. They are actually caused by cosmic debris trailing in the wake of comets and asteroids.When the Earth passes through these fragments and particles, pieces fall into the atmosphere and burn up - which is why we can see them as a streak of light in the sky.The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is named after the star Eta Aquarii in the constellation of Aquarius, where the meteors appear to radiate from in the night sky.In the northern hemisphere, this will appear low in the sky in the early pre-dawn hours of May 6.But it should still be possible to see the shower in the eastern sky, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.It's not the only celestial event worth watching this week.Thursday May 7 also marks the fourth and final super moon of 2020.The Super Flower Moon was so-called by early Native Americans because it ushered in the blooming of spring flowers.It is also known as the Corn Planting Moon or the Milk Moon.During a supermoon, the moon can appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a normal full moon.The phenomenon happens when the moon is full at the same time as, or very near, perigee - its closest point to Earth on an elliptical, monthly orbit.
